1nix0xq,nem4kba,My “C.K. was a racist” response video,2025-09-16 23:28:19+00:00,58,"Charlie Kirk was moderate with christian values

If you watched his podcast and disagreed with him you could literally search up turning point USA schedule, fly there, and bring up your argument without any fear. 

There were times when Charlie Kirk agreed and advocated whatever argument someone from the left brought. There are multiple clips of this

This man was far from racist, or anything hateful and they killed them. They killed them for debating in the most free way as possible."

Whenever they lose an argument they say you are a racist. I was called a racist hundreds of times because I said I wasn't going to vote for Barack Obama because of his policies. Same with Kamala Harris. If you remember, any negative thing that you ever said about Kamala Harris, if you were white, they would call you a racist. I would think that they know by now that we just don't listen to that word anymore because they have diluted it to water."

The Left has slowly pushed society into tolerating a 300 pound man claiming to be a mom ready to give birth. Since the election the change has been palpable. Folks like Charlie have been a huge part of that culture shift. The Left is lashing out. It doesnt matter though. Charlie won and the cultural shift is in motion.

All the cops mob that screaming old dude, there’s far less canvassing of the area not to mention if they think they’ve got the shooter, they’ll stop looking for Tyler.  Whether it amounts to something…we’ll see.  

This on top of DNCs drastically reduced registrations?  They’re essentially set to not only lose the district argument and the midterms…it’s likely they won’t recover enough for 2028.  Not that I’m surprised, but this came at the absolute worst time for the DNC.  We should be prepared for more drastic action because reality is starting to set in on them that their power struggle and efforts, just came to an abrupt halt.  

From a standpoint..they’ve literally been backed against a wall where they cannot avoid responsibility or connection.  Wounded animals backed into corners are the most dangerous as they’ve nothing left to loose."

1nisuq3,nemopfl,"genuine question, what is so bad about accepting gay and trans people for who they are and letting them be happy? What is wrong with exposing children to lgbtq stuff either? How does a pride flag in classrooms hurt them?",2025-09-17 01:26:00+00:00,10,"Conservative/Republican angle:

Acceptance vs. Endorsement: Conservatives will often say, “I can accept someone’s existence and right to live freely without being required to celebrate, endorse, or promote their lifestyle.” For them, there’s a difference between tolerance (live and let live) and institutional endorsement (making Pride flags a fixture in classrooms).

Parental Rights: Many conservatives believe it’s not the school’s job to introduce children to LGBTQ topics, especially at young ages. They feel those conversations, like discussions about sex, gender identity, or relationships, belong in the home, led by parents.

Age Appropriateness: The argument isn’t always “never,” but more about “when.” Conservatives tend to say: kids in elementary school don’t need to hear about sexuality (straight or gay). Teaching them about math, reading, and history should come before introducing social or identity topics.

Neutral Classrooms: A Pride flag might look harmless, but some conservatives argue it signals political advocacy in a space that should remain neutral. In their eyes, it’s no different than hanging a “Vote Republican” sign. Classrooms should stick to academics, not ideology.

Slippery Slope Concerns: Some genuinely fear that once schools start emphasizing LGBTQ symbols and topics, it could normalize teachers discussing intimate or controversial issues with kids who aren’t ready, or even undermine parents who want a more traditional upbringing for their child.

Yes, LGBTQ Conservatives Exist: Many of them will tell you, “I don’t need a Pride flag in a classroom to validate who I am.” They’d argue that being LGBTQ is one part of their identity, but not one that schools should elevate over everything else.


“You do you, just don’t drag kids into it.” Most conservatives aren’t out there trying to police the lives of gay or trans adults. They just draw a hard line at schools, government, and cultural institutions turning into social-issue battlegrounds.

“Media makes us look way harsher than we are.”  both sides cherry-pick the worst soundbites. A thoughtful conservative saying “I accept gay people but I don’t want rainbow flags in elementary classrooms” doesn’t go viral. A fringe nutjob screaming does.

“It’s about boundaries, not hatred.” Conservatives generally frame it as “protecting kids’ innocence and parental rights” rather than “rejecting LGBTQ people.” The media often skips that part because “conservatives want to keep kids being kids” isn’t as clickable as “conservatives want to erase gay people.”

“LGBTQ conservatives exist.” And they’ll tell you straight up: “I don’t need validation from a school flag or a curriculum to be who I am. I just want the government and schools out of my personal life, the same way I don’t want them in my wallet.”


That’s why “live and let live” is the phrase you hear so often. Conservatives don’t necessarily want to control the LGBTQ community; they just don’t want to be controlled by it. Especially through policy, schools, or cultural mandates. We do support ""pride"" what we dont support the LGBTQ walking around with their privates showing spanking each other right in front of children. Thats not really ""this is just our culure!"" They say that so they can normalize it. 


I know it's hard to understand the way the left often portrays the right, but you are honestly a LOT safer being an open-minded person of a marginalized community walking onto the right side of the aisle than the left. You can find countless amounts of TikTok videos of people from these communities who ""left the left"" or open their mind a little bit, only to have the left hurl rocks at them for stepping out of the line."
1nisuq3,nemkuhj,"genuine question, what is so bad about accepting gay and trans people for who they are and letting them be happy? What is wrong with exposing children to lgbtq stuff either? How does a pride flag in classrooms hurt them?",2025-09-17 01:03:25+00:00,3,"Ok, let me explain. I can tell that you're just listening to your side. You don't really actually know what conservatives really think about gay and trans individuals. You listen to your side and all of the hyperbolic stuff that they say. But let me explain it to you.

No one cares what you adults do. I think a lot of people are born gay. Because how in the world can, say a man, just decide to be gay lol. I know a lot of heterosexual men that you could never turn gay even if you pointed a gun to their head. So I personally believe a lot of people are born that way. I have personally known some women tell me that they turned gay because of sexual abuse. But that's neither here or there because that's their decision. Conservatives for the most part do not have a problem with gay people. Of course different religions have different opinions on gay marriage etc. And that includes Islam, which conveniently most LBGT people support and have absolutely no issue with even though some Muslim people in the United States and other countries can't stand gay individuals.

As far as trans. I would say less than 10 years ago conservatives had no problem with trans individuals. I think it all started when the drag queens came out and decided to mix in with our kids. I think a lot of that was done on purpose to antagonize conservatives at that time. I remember them saying they were going to turn our kids gay or wanted to dance in front of conservative children etc. That's when the ""drag queen story hour"" started. And if you think about it, no one in the world cared about drag queens before that. I certainly didn't care. They had their thing going on in bars and I thought that was great. It wasn't brought Into the arena of children. But with decades and decades of nobody caring about drag queens, all of a sudden they wanted to mix in with our children. This was something totally new.

After a few years of that, obviously the LBGT community were very angry at us for not accepting that. I don't really know why, because anyone could see that once you started messing with our children, especially in schools where there was no permission from the parents, it was inevitable the parents were going to freak out. And rightly so. And at that point, obviously we knew trans individuals existed and we didn't have an opinion on it really. But this was new.

Now we get into when they decided that the drag queen thing wasn't enough....we now have to say that being a man or woman is something you can just ""say"". And letting men with penises into bathrooms with little girls became a thing that liberals had NO issue with. And mind you, this WAS NOT a thing anywhere for hundreds if not thousands of years. Now all of a sudden, like a light switch is turned on, liberals think that men could be women and those men in bathrooms, showers etc. with our girls, should be OK.

Then you add men being allowed to compete in women's sports, something we've never did in the United States and other countries EVER,  the point they were literally taking away long-held records by women. Many young women being hurt by these men. Again, liberals etc. just could not wrap their head around while we would be upset at that.  And as conservative parents, we could not understand why this had to be introduced all of a sudden into history. Just using logic anyone could see that a man should not compete against a woman. It's just not fair.

And then lastly, liberal supporting kids getting their sexual organs cut off. Supporting getting their breasts removed as if this had been going on forever lol. We just don't support that. Again we're talking about children here, not anyone over 18. Your side came after the kids. And they had this attitude of, if you're against ANY of this, you were violence. ""You must have some kind of phobia"". There was NO debate allowed. If you try to debate a trans individual, as you can see in many hundreds of videos, they will violently attack you. Or say that your speech is violence. You're either on their side or you are a Nazi.

The trans movement does not allow debate. It wants to bully parents into allowing people to give their children medication without their permission. They want the schools to be able to call their children other names beside the name they were born with without their parents permission. Did you really think this was going to fly?????? We don't hate those people. We just disagree. That's really it. I think it would be a good idea to watch some conservative leaning gay and trans individuals. Many trans individuals that have transitioned back have been met with a lot of hate from the trans community."
1nisuq3,nemolkk,"genuine question, what is so bad about accepting gay and trans people for who they are and letting them be happy? What is wrong with exposing children to lgbtq stuff either? How does a pride flag in classrooms hurt them?",2025-09-17 01:25:20+00:00,1,"Hi, i'll try and address your questions as best i can.

What is so bad about accepting gay people: I think the vast majority of MAGA is fine with gay people. In fact, one of our most influential leaders in the efforts to get Trump re-elected was a gay man, Scott Presler.  What you may see sometimes is folks having a problem with gay marriage, and that stems from religious belief that marriage is between a man and woman. That being said, the issue with those folks is specifically with marriage, not gay people having the choice to be gay. Now, if you mean accepting gay people to the point that we are actively supporting being gay, and cheering it on, that's not fair to ask of us as for many of us it is simply against our values.

What is so bad about accepting trans people: The issue with ""accepting"" trans people is that they are living a lifestyle of delusion, and respecting or accepting them means we have to actively play a part in their delusions. Further, these people are simply mentally ill and they need help. Just like i don't want to have to play make believe with a skitzo, i don't want to do it with a tranny either. The left thinks affirming their delusions is the way, we don't.

What is wrong with exposing children to LGBT stuff: Because a lot of us view this stuff as as filth, or sinful, and against our values, and we are not okay with other people trying to exert their values onto our impressionable children. You want to have sex with other dudes, or play dress-up as a woman, fine, but why do you have the right to force that crap on my kids?"

How does a pride flag in classrooms hurt them?",2025-09-17 12:21:05+00:00,1,"Short answer: It goes against a lot of our beliefs, especially Biblical beliefs, but we don't deny that you have the freedom to choose whatever sexual lifestyle you want, it just doesn't fit our Biblical belief system. Most of us are fine with that and will ignore it and move on without saying anything unless someone wants true, honest, open discussion.

The problem is that there is a large group of liberals who want to shove that lifestyle down everyone's throat, and are actively trying to indoctrinate young kids to choose it without their parents being involved. That is something we'll always have a problem with.

If you shove it down someone's throat continually, you've invoked opposition. If you want to take away a family's ability to have influence on their own children, you are trying to control the narrative and silence opposition. These things are NOT OK."

I know people that thought I was an awful person because I didn't vote for Kamala Harris lol. I mean it's so subjective as to what people think is hateful or awful. I think a lot of people years ago thought he was just this perfect Christian man who never did anything wrong who had a really good movement but didn't know anything about his personal life. And that's all Charle was talking about. But it doesn't matter. Because you don't shoot someone in the throat that has that opinion. None of this matters when one side is advocating for CEOs to be shot and conservatives to be assassinated.

1nip6im,neljt4k,Still finding it baffling how they are trying to say Kirk's shooter was an ultra far right nationalist,2025-09-16 21:31:58+00:00,6,"Another Brit here.

  
Your summary seems about right. When I first heard Kirk had been shot, I wasn't an avid viewer of his content but I was aware of who he was so like most people I assumed a crazy leftist had done it. With all of the evidence coming out since, it's obvious our assumptions were correct.

  
I don't think the left leaning people who are claiming the shooter was far right even believe it themselves and interestingly enough that goes for a lot of the things they say - for example when they say things like ""we'll never have another election again"" they know they will, they're just fear mongering. And when they say things like ""men can get pregnant"" of course they know that's not true, they just think it's something they HAVE to say. 

  
The MSNBC guy who, immediately after news broke about Kirk being shot and before we knew his condition, tried to blame it on a supporter AND then basically said he deserved it anyway sums up the response from a lot on the left ever since.....""hey, it wasn't us but he kind of had it coming"".

  
They know the shooter was a radical leftist but they'll continue spreading their lies no matter what - the guy could literally tell us himself and they'd claim it's fake or something. If they admit he was one of them, they'll be forced to look in the mirror and perhaps ask themselves if they're really the good guys. Ask themselves if they should change their behaviour. Ask themselves if they should stop calling people names like 'fascist' and 'nazi'. By denying it, they can continue as they were before.

  
In some ways though, I think it could be a good thing what they're doing. Part of the shooters motive for doing what he did could very well have been inspired by the reaction of the left to the Luigi Mangione shooting. The hero-worship he's recieved since, maybe the shooter thought he'd get the same treatement if he took out Kirk? But instead of being hailed as a hero, his own kind are calling him a conservative, far right and MAGA. Something tells me he'd hate to be labelled as those things more than being labelled as a murderer. Perhaps the next leftist lunatic out there thinking of doing something like this might think twice because of that. We can hope."

Don't be baffled lol. They believe it just like you do. They're just not going to admit it. That's all this is. You don't have to explain it out or anything. They are deflecting and projecting. They know that this guy is on the left, but they know what that will do to their side. That's all this is. Don't waste a bunch of time on it."
1nip6im,nemvy21,Still finding it baffling how they are trying to say Kirk's shooter was an ultra far right nationalist,2025-09-17 02:08:48+00:00,3,I dont. They know they fucked up with this one big time. Anyone being assassinated for speech is wrong. He is the one they should not have touched and they are trying to spin it for any fence sitters they possibly can because this shines a bright light on them in ways it hasn't been done and stops them from being able to grow there numbers. The fuck nut the did this being left is a huge nail in there coffin possibly the last and they know it.

 Since CK was shot and killed by a leftist, people are watching his videos themselves and what the left are saying about him are being shown as nothing more than more lies

- No one would accuse an Fuentes of being on the left. Listen to what Nick Fuentes has to say about Kirk.  
- There is no evidence that he was wearing black tactical gear before he assassinated Kirk.

And so on."

I don’t think the kid cared about politics in terms of “left wing” or “right wing” I truly believe he “did it for the lulz”. I am in the middle of my political view and follow leftist politics, but never understood the gropyer term or had the “furry culture” shown to me out of nowhere. I don’t watch or heavily trust CNN, so best to do more research than to complete say this guy is definitely “far-left” or “far-right”.

I think one thing that will come from this Charlie Kirk murder is business is not putting up with people celebrating murder. Are people turning their heads and acting like there is no leftist hate or leftist violence all over the place. People are sick of it. One example is the fire bombing of Tesla dealerships and The left celebrating that. Do you think car companies of any type want the left working for them if they're OK with this?Do you think dealerships want someone on the left working for them if they're OK with this?

I think it finally got banned when the George Floyd stuff happened, but I may be wrong about that"

I mostly stick to uplifting pet subs and try to avoid political debates with people who seem to live for arguing in their parents’ basements. There’s plenty of good here, but the overwhelming left-leaning slant makes it tough to enjoy sometimes. Too often, people seem more interested in downvoting and self-righteously arguing than actually engaging.

Even news subs that should be neutral end up filled with propaganda. I broke my own rule and left two comments on some outrageous takes about Charlie Kirk—I just couldn’t let them slide without at least some rebuttal. I fully expect a pile of downvotes and the usual name-calling in return.

It’s frustrating how Reddit tolerates so much uninformed hate speech while making it so hard to have an honest, balanced discussion."

Don’t respond with Trump this or Trump that or what someone else said or should be asking…that’s just a distraction from the bottom line topic.  

Point blank…would they feel it’s appropriate if the situation was reversed?  What would they do if the opposing party was cheering for political assassination of their delegates?  Their answer should be all the evidence you need whether it’s yes or no.

**Yes** would mean they’re essentially dangerous to anyone who they disagree with.  **No** would mean they’ve basically been willingly gaslighting their voters with their rhetoric."

1nkjsjs,nezqmyx,I’m a democrat and I’d love to know your individual thoughts on Kimmel’s comments,2025-09-19 01:16:45+00:00,24,"Short answer. It doesn't matter what we think. It matters what his bosses think. Disney reportedly did not like the comments. They asked him to apologize and he didn't. There were some other entertainment companies around the country that were pissed off about what he said and how he said it, so they played part in it. He literally implied that some standard Trump supporter was the guy that shot Charlie Kirk. Obviously with all of the evidence, that's not true. And anyone could see that he was insinuating that all Maga individuals could do this. And this is not the first time he's did these type of things on television. His show went from a late-night comedy show to a Trump arrangement syndrome Show. And the executives solve this. His show doesn't even rank in the top 100. Disney had enough and put him on suspension. Just like other entertainers that had their hand slapped because of things they've said.

In the end, to see liberals freaking out about this while laughing at Charle Kirk and his family, makes me sick to my stomach. They're yelling about free speech, while celebrating a man being shot in the fucking throat while sitting in a fucking chair debating college kids who volunteered to be there. And we still have liberal college kids threatening conservative kids as we speak. This is all coming out now. So, I'm not worried about Jimmy Kimmel. I'm worried about who the next college kid assassin is."
1nkjsjs,nezqtco,I’m a democrat and I’d love to know your individual thoughts on Kimmel’s comments,2025-09-19 01:17:46+00:00,14,"Kimmel said ""... the MAGA gang ***desperately trying*** \[meaning: ""attempted but did not succeed""\] to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them ...""

The extant evidence says otherwise. The evidence shows that the shooter was animated to violence by LGBT propaganda. Kimmel lied when he said the shooter was a MAGA, pro-Trump supporter; thus, violating the terms of the FCC license held by ABC.

The 1st Amendment in no manner protects a partisan hack's use of licensed public airways to propagate lies."
1nkjsjs,nezvvp8,I’m a democrat and I’d love to know your individual thoughts on Kimmel’s comments,2025-09-19 01:46:57+00:00,11,"My opinion is that we are tired of lies and propaganda that is pervasive on leftist media. He was doing the typical lying that we constantly see. He spewed that the assassin was a republican....blah blah blah. I think anyone in the media, left or right should be fired and prosecuted for lying to the public. Obama made all that shtt legal and thats why it happens day in and day out. His show was tanking to begin with and IMO this was just the last straw to get rid of him. It wasnt just because of his BS statement. Most of the leftist media is tanking in general because all they do is spread lies propaganda and hate, and ALL people are sick of it. Dont take my word for it look up all the stats for every show, left AND right."

He is not allowed to lie maliciously. I don’t know the wording of the regulation. Feel free to post it. 

I don’t think his comments on ck were bad. And his fourth stage of grief joke was actually funny. 

He did claim the killer was MAGA. 

I think he believed it. But if he lied that’s different. 

The FCC did pressure ABC. But also hemmed and said they needed to be careful…. I don’t think it matters. A governing body that can revoke your license only needs to hint for it to be oppressive. 

One would suspect that there would be long established procedures to keep the FCC from being abusive. One would also suspect they can get around it quite easily.  Lastly, they provably have been abusive multiple times under various administrations. 

This could be an opportunity to restrain the FCC. 

I’m conservative and won’t abandon my belief in free speech."

He obviously hates Trump but this wasn’t Trump. This was a guy literally fighting to have conversation with people like Jimmy Kimmel everyday. Why go out and make insensitive or comments of any kind? 

JK was already on thin ice because people were tired of what the show became. This just made it easy for Disney. NexStar had already put notice out well before the FCC chairman said anything. Why? Most likely because they had viewer backlash. Advertisers upset. These networks are in business to make money. Make advertisers mad and it usually doesn’t end well. 

Then after everything last week and the rush of absolutely horrible liberal left social media comments how can you defend anyone on the left? A man died. This wasn’t some horrible guy. This was one that truly was doing good. Opening up the conversation between people that dont agree and you guys are laughing and celebrating. Very hard to take you or any left wing person serious."

Kimmel’s show has been hemorrhaging viewers for years. He’s down to something like a few hundred thousand a night. Yikes. His comment about Kirk was just the last straw. His lack of empathy is pretty shocking. 

FWIW, if any of us (Conservatives) dare try to post what we consider common sense on any number of subreddits, we’re instantly banned. Sad, really. Open discourse seems to be a thing of the past. Ironically, that’s exactly that Charlie was trying to do- open up discourse. 😕"
1nkjsjs,nfeo17v,I’m a democrat and I’d love to know your individual thoughts on Kimmel’s comments,2025-09-21 12:24:21+00:00,2,"1) Kimmel said it was a MAGA supporter who killed Kirk which was demonstably false at the time he said it.

2) The government DID NOT influenced him getting fired. The viewers did. the ABC affiliates were already pulling Kimmel based on audience reactions when Carr made his statement.

3) Kimmel has an obligation to be accurate on the public airwaves. He has a right to free speech but the FCC obligation is; Public broadcasters like ABC are [prohibited from spreading false information](https://www.fcc.gov/media/radio/public-and-broadcasting#JOURNALISM) about a crime or catastrophe, and they can lose their licensure if they don’t adhere to the relevant federal regulations.

4) As you see from #3 they ""are [prohibited from spreading false information](https://www.fcc.gov/media/radio/public-and-broadcasting#JOURNALISM) "" That is not overreach, it's the law."
1nkjsjs,nff1ccs,I’m a democrat and I’d love to know your individual thoughts on Kimmel’s comments,2025-09-21 13:45:26+00:00,2,"A few things to remember 1. Jimmy’s staff submits everything before the show is aired, to ABC’s legal team before a show is aired.  2. Jimmy’s ratings have been in the toilet for quite some time. 3. Jimmy makes $16MM plus per year. 4. Jimmy’s contract is up in 6 months.  
I believe the legal staff allowed the show to air and then used his comments to stop the show = stop paying Jimmy’s remaining contact. As far as my opinion on his comments… Jimmy’s comments were certainly worse than Rosanne’s or Tucker’s or Gina’s.  The irony is wonderful."

Instead of ignoringbthe issue like fallon, or saying a moment of realness like seth and colbert, kimmel- in his douchey way, decided to paint more targets on maga and stir up more college students with lies. A person dying for having a discussion on a college campus is NOT normal, nor should be acceptable, nor should be used as a cheap shot >.> to demonize more people like the victim.

I don't think mocking murder is a good look, personally."
1nkjsjs,ng3pc4w,I’m a democrat and I’d love to know your individual thoughts on Kimmel’s comments,2025-09-25 10:26:46+00:00,1,"The FCC has been regulating speech on broadcast TV for as long as I can remember, I don't see any reason I should be upset about it now even if the FCC had actually taken action against ABC which doesn't appear to be the case.  There were a few comments from FCC officials I guess about maybe looking into taking action but that doesn't mean anything no matter what viewpoint you take towards the FCC.

From my impression of Kimmel's comments and I didn't really carefully review them or anything cause I don't care much about things most entertainers say outside of a script, he was implying a false narrative of a right wing shooter.  I don't believe wilful lies are actually free speech but that doesn't mean I believe all wilful lies demand government intervention either (e.g. fraud, confidence tricks, libel and defamation are not generally considered free speech cause they don't contain an expression but a deliberate lie and intent to deceive rather than an attempt to express)."

Trump has a big ego, we all know it—and he has been salivating at the thought of Kimmel going under for awhile now.

What happened was a censorship of freedom of speech. Trump doesn't care about Charlie Kirk, the man immediately jumped to talking about his expensive and lavish ballroom hobby.

Gary Gilmore was executed in Utah in 1977 by a firing squad. It only took 6 months. Most people in death row get to live years and years until they get executed by lethal injection.

I hope this piece of shit doesn’t get to live another 6 months. Someone might even do a “Jack Ruby” on him. This poor excuse of a human being ignited another American Civil War.

But imagine if all the teachers who celebrated Kirk's assassination weren't fired from their jobs. A third or more of children might have been pulled out of these schools. People don't want these maniacs to continue to brainwash their children. When the classrooms are half empty, they would lose funding. More importantly, parents would find out homeschooling is way better than these failed public schools where children are not only brainwashed by leftist propaganda, kids either get bullied or become the bullies. They would find out that kids only need 2-3 hours of schooling a day with online tests to ensure they are keeping up with curriculum. They would find out that most of schooling is BUSY work they get from the back of these teachers books, which is why they love the photocopy machines so much. They would find out that teachers are actually overpaid. They work 9 months a year and compare their jobs to salaries of 12 month jobs. Let's not forget their fat pensions. They would rather pretend they are underpaid than to give up their fat pensions. Zero accountability in these public schools that have been failing for decades. They don't want to get rid of the bad apples because it's JOB SECURITY. They also don't want smaller classroom sizes for the same reason, if they hire too many teachers, they lose job security so they would rather hire tons more administrators using all the money they get."

Most of us wanted them gone, rightfully so, because American jobs should not be getting replaced or outsourced to people from India. This pissed off Elon Musk, who said he would go to war over this issue, and in a move that pissed off lots of MAGA, Trump made comments supporting H1-B Visas.

Well, hopefully the same people that were angry about those comments are paying attention now, because it looks like Trump has yet again listened to his base and adjusted appropriately by taking steps to disincentivize H1-B visas.

I do have a problem with it though if this becomes a regular thing or people left of center start getting banned/canceled on social media. Revenge can feel good but winning is actually bringing back free speech and taking away their power to cancel permanently, not just using that power yourself, especially if it’s with the full force of the federal government instead of annoying SJW’s on twitter. What are we really achieving if every 4 years we spend our whole time keeping score and getting retribution?

Did Biden and Harris pressure social media sites and websites to censor and removed covid evidence and data?

[https://x.com/i/grok/share/kWunqeqm8bSH0H7bA53zMMYXd](https://x.com/i/grok/share/kWunqeqm8bSH0H7bA53zMMYXd)

Yes, there is substantial evidence indicating that the Biden administration pressured social media platforms like Meta (Facebook and Instagram) and Alphabet (YouTube), as well as websites like Amazon, to censor and remove content related to COVID-19 that was deemed misinformation. This included vaccine hesitancy, side effects discussions, the lab-leak theory, satire, memes, and even true information or personal experiences that discouraged vaccination. The administration has characterized these efforts as encouragements for platforms to take responsible actions against disinformation during a public health crisis, rather than coercive pressure, and emphasized that platforms made independent decisions on content moderation.

Key details from reports and admissions:  
\- Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated in an August 2024 letter to the House Judiciary Committee that senior Biden administration officials repeatedly pressured his teams for months to censor COVID-19 content during the pandemic, including humor and satire. He expressed regret for complying and not pushing back more publicly at the time. In a January 2025 podcast appearance, Zuckerberg further described White House officials as ""screaming"" and ""cursing"" when seeking removals of content critical of COVID vaccines.  
\- A May 2024 House Judiciary Committee report, based on subpoenaed documents, outlined a coordinated White House campaign starting in early 2021 to coerce platforms into altering content moderation policies. For instance:  
\- Facebook was pushed to demote or remove vaccine-discouraging posts, including true side-effect reports and lab-leak discussions, leading to policy changes by August 2021.  
\- YouTube faced demands to address ""borderline"" content (not violating rules but seen as problematic), resulting in a September 2021 policy update to remove claims questioning vaccine safety or efficacy.  
\- Amazon was criticized for selling anti-vaccine books, prompting a rapid ""Do Not Promote"" policy implementation in March 2021 to reduce their visibility.  
\- The Supreme Court in June 2024 ruled in \*Murthy v. Missouri\* that challengers (Republican-led states) lacked standing to sue over alleged coercion, but did not address the merits of whether the administration's actions violated the First Amendment. The case involved similar claims of pressure on platforms to suppress COVID misinformation.

Regarding Vice President Kamala Harris' involvement: While the efforts were led by the Biden White House and no direct actions are attributed to Harris personally in the available evidence, the administration is often referred to as ""Biden-Harris,"" and key figures involved have ties to her. Notably, Rob Flaherty, the former White House Director of Digital Strategy, was a central voice in these pressures—he emailed and met with Google and Facebook in 2021 to demand data on misinformation trends, push for removals of ""borderline"" vaccine content, and seek special government access to targeting tools for addressing side-effect concerns. Flaherty is now deputy campaign manager for Harris' 2024 presidential campaign, providing a direct link. During the October 2024 vice presidential debate, JD Vance accused Harris of supporting ""widespread censorship"" of misinformation, citing her public statements on the need for platforms to combat online harms, though this was more broadly tied to her role in a task force on online harassment rather than specific COVID actions.

The administration's perspective, as stated in responses to Zuckerberg's claims, maintains that they encouraged tech companies to prioritize public health by addressing disinformation that endangered lives, without crossing into improper coercion. No official denials of the interactions have been issued; instead, spokespeople have reiterated the focus on saving lives during the pandemic. Critics, including congressional Republicans, argue these actions amounted to unconstitutional censorship of protected speech, including factual or opinion-based content."

But yeah, it actually is different.

I think you’re probably saying in good faith that the dems started this, but I don’t think they did. Trump is throwing the first stones here. Capitalism revolvs around the idea that companies self-regulate themselves based on public sentiment. People pressuring companies to act a certain way is at the very heart of healthy capitalism. Same with politicans and democracy.

Sure, the government does need to step in sometimes for health and safety reasons, but politicans using their governmental positions to pressure the cancellation of their political opponents is not capitalism. It’s called authoritarianism and there should be a bi-partisan effort to draw the line with this.

The first amendment exists specifically to stop the goverment from asserting pressure in this way. You cannot compare public outcry with governmental power."

>(the assassins) do it because they are expected to, not because it’s their belief.

There you seem to answer your own question. They are ""expected"" to do it because it is condoned by many democrats thru justifications and lionizing of the killers and thru blaming the victims.

The talk on the right is that the ***hate filled rhetoric*** used by the most deplorable democrats has created a society where these types of sociopathic reactions are to be expected -those Dems are encouraging the actions while turning around and condemning them after the fact.

Institutions (media, NGOs) need to be investigated and individuals need to be called out. We are at a point where they (The machine) has all ready conditioned way too many people to see violence as a logical reaction. The vast majority needs to see the Machine's evil ways, and complaining isn't the way to bring about realization, imho.

But maybe we can create change on one one. A recent rather long text chat with a  friend (MSNBC viewer) I finally  got her to admit that celebrating Kirks assassination is wrong and horrible -she kept avoiding the question (meanwhile MSNBC is telling her no one on the left celebrated it). It took a while. I had to go logical point by logical point. I don't know if everyone can do that. But if you talk with concern and compassion rather than shaming (like the left does) I think that's a better way to weed past the BS and get thru to the logic and appeal to people's sense of morality."

Original Antifa (Antifaschistische Aktion) was a communist group in Germany in 1932, organized by the KPD against Nazis, suppressed in 1933. 
No active role during WW2; it wasn’t a military or political entity in the war.

Modern Antifa is a decentralized network of anti-fascist activists, starting in the 1980s from Anti-Racist Action in the US. 9 18 Inspired by historical anti-fascism but no direct organizational connection to the 1930s group or WW2 fighters.
Today’s Antifa is strongly violent and anarchist, with roots in anarchist ideology and tactics including physical violence, property damage, and clashes with opponents. 
Violence is documented in incidents like protests and counter-demonstrations, though not universal and some sources note it’s marginal compared to right-wing threats; anarchist ties are clear from self-descriptions.

In WW2, Allies fought the Axis: Germany (Nazis under Hitler), Italy (Fascists under Mussolini), and Japan (imperialists/militarists). Japan wasn’t fascist like Italy but allied with them via the 1940 Tripartite Pact.

Sources: Wikipedia on Antifa (US), GWU on Anarchist Left-Wing Extremism, CSIS on Escalating Terrorism, EBSCO on Far Left Violence, Congress on Left-Wing Violence, Brewminate on Political Violence, Counterextremism on Far-Left Groups, ISD on US Antifa, ADL on Who are Antifa. What do you think?"

He was right about MLK though, hate to break it to you

MLK **was** a great voice for his time. He was wonderful

1nm8p1o,nfb7abf,You can be a fan of Charlie kirk and not agree with everything he said...,2025-09-20 20:57:56+00:00,4,"""They look at our dismissal of their martyr, our refusal to mourn, our indifference to his noise, and they interpret it as violence. To them, it is dangerous to shrug off a man they believe matters more than the rest of us. That's the center of it. They believe they hold a higher human value. It's how they square their hollow version of Christianity with their politics of cruelty. When Christ said ""the least of these"", they never imagined he meant the immigrant at the southern border, a black family choking on poverty, or a homeless man with dirt in his hair and under his fingernails. In their reading, Jesus was speaking only of their kind. They're respectable, the saved, the ones who vote like they do. Everyone else is written out of the scripture by assumption. So when we reject their prophets, when we refuse to honor their heroes, when we laugh at their idols, they feel hunted. They see extremism not because we are violent, but because their sense of human worth stops at their own skin. And once you believe that your soul alone matters, any challenge to your supremacy feels like a knife at your throat. This is how they can hold rallies calling for executions and still kneel in church pews with a clean conscience. They do not believe their cruelty is cruelty. They believe it's order. They see themselves as guardians of civilization, protectors of morality, keepers of the flame. What they cannot recognize is that the flame they keep is only lit for them. That their morality begins and ends in the mirror. To them, loving their neighbors easy because they've erased half the damn neighborhood. And this is why they call progressives and leftists violent extremist. Because we dare to remind them that the scripture they clutch is not selective. That the word neighbor has no footnotes. That Christ did not carve out exceptions for skin color, bank balance, or birthplace. They hear us speak and they feel the ground beneath them shake. Not because our voices carry violence, but because their foundation has always been built on the lie that they alone are fully human. They don't call themselves supremacists because they assume everyone sees the world the same way they do. They assume superiority is a natural order and that we are simply being fussy about equality. They think we mistake their hierarchy for cruelty when in fact to them it is just common sense. But they never stop to ask how it feels to be on the other side of that common sense. They never consider that their sermons about law and order sound like funeral durges to the people who've been crushed underneath them. So they rage at our refusal to bow. They rage at our dismissal of their saints. They rage at our laughter. To them it is proof of our violence, evidence of our extremism.  
But the truth is simpler and much sharper. We frighten them not because we threaten their lives, but because we threaten their delusion that only their lives matter. They don't want their children reading Baldwin or Hughes or Morrison or Goldman because they don't believe those lived experiences matter. They don't want their children to know what it feels like to carry the weight of a skin color, a border crossing, a factory job, or a jail sentence. They don't want their children to grow into empathy because empathy would shatter the myth that only they are fully human.  
To teach their children those voices would mean admitting that suffering has value, that injustice exists, that dignity is not confined to the pews of their own church or the suburbs of their own neighborhoods. And if their children knew that, the whole structure would collapse. So they ban the books. They silence the poets. They sneer at the dangerous women who write about freedom. They are terrified that their children might look at Baldwin's words and see a human being instead of an enemy. That they might read Hughes and hear the blues as a hymn of survival instead of noise from the margins. To them, that is the real danger. Not violence, not hate, but the possibility that empathy might cross the picket line of their supremacy.  
And at the heart of it all is this brittle belief in scarcity. To them, the pie is static. There is only so much dignity, so much freedom, so much worth to go around. And if someone else is given a slice, then theirs must shrink.  
It is a worldview poisoned by fear, hoarding, and the false comfort of the walls they build. But to those of us with any measure of moral fiber, to those of us who believe in the radical decency of human beings, we know the table can be bigger. We know that all the ingredients exist in abundance and that more pie can be made. And that's the difference. They live in a world of subtraction. We live in a world of creation. They cling to a narrow kingdom built on exclusion while we insist on a republic built on abundance. And it is that vision, the vision of bigger tables and endless pie that terrifies them most because if their children ever tasted that, ever saw society through that lens, they would never go back.""

Yes, Kimmel lied when he said what he did about the guy who murdered Kirk.  Yes, he was speaking as if what he was saying was fact - not a joke.  But the constitution does not only guarantee you free speech if you are cracking jokes.  It guarantees you free speech.  Period.  If Kimmel wants to stand there each night and say Trump is made out of cheese he can do that.

I don't know what the line is for free speech.  I do know that what Kimmel said is not anywhere close to that line.

And let’s be strategic. 

There’s no need to make a comment on a discussion that already has 5000 comments. Or even 300. 

There’s no need to go back and forth with someone who treats you like a jerk, will never change, and the conversation will be seen by a grand total of four people. 

There’s no need to initiate with an idiot. 

The word fascist has lost all meaning. Ignore anything or anyone who invokes the word. Don’t even begin. Let it fade. 

Reddit suggests not to downvote the assholes. And here we are, angry, divided, and getting no where. Instead, don’t downvote polite people you disagree with. Do downvote jerks and comments that say  nazi or fascist. 

Irrelevant comments distract from good ones. You’ve just found a great discussion with the perfect topic and when you open it all the top comments say “yea, I wouldn’t eat that anyway”. Downvote those. They only had one upvote anyway, you can flip them negative. 

Don’t be a jerk. 

Research before posting. 

Give up when it’s gone south. 

Admit when you’re wrong or made a mistake. 

Don’t say “all, everyone” or any absolute statement. 

Don’t stereotype. Don’t be a bigot."

For every manufactruing job we create we create 74 additional jobs in the economy. Everything in America revolves around businesses and free trade and Trump is for it all."

Life was better = Gas prices / Food Prices / Taxes. **You are young and you need to learn this lesson now instead of when your 35.**

***VOTE WITH YOUR WALLET***. *Not your feelings, not your friends feelings. Not feelings from reddit or the television. YOUR WALLET.*

The only thing you should care about is which political party is going to keep more of your hard earned money in your pocket. That is all that matters.

1nmg6dc,nfiberq,What's up with the mentally ill on r/pics calling american armed forces veterans antifa?,2025-09-21 23:16:46+00:00,7,Just some retarded trend - they're basically trying to edit history and make it seem like the soldiers in WW2 were fighting for the same things 'antifa' (who's everyone that's not MAGA 'supposedly'?) are fighting for now - Which is hilarious as those soldiers would have beat the shit out of them with a bible if they saw they were only just celebrating shooting someone because they thought there's only two genders.
1nmg6dc,nfilx73,What's up with the mentally ill on r/pics calling american armed forces veterans antifa?,2025-09-22 00:19:35+00:00,5,"It's a tawdry, uneducated attempt to appropriate the honor of men and women who put their lives on the line to defend American values, traditions and institutions during WWII. Those WWII American servicemen were fighting Axis powers that had attacked and defamed America's values and institutions.

On the other hand, Antifa was a Soviet (read Stalin) backed Communist faction in pre-WWII Germany. Stalin gave Hitler shelter in the Soviet Union, hidden from prying Western eyes, to build and train Germany's infamous Panzer armies. Stalin was the mastermind behind the 1932-33 Holodomor Famine in Ukraine where millions of Ukrainians died of starvation. Stalin's armies invaded Poland from the east as Hitler's armies invaded Poland from the west.

In Germany, Stalin's communist/Antifa agents sometimes coordinated with the Nazis to bring down the Weimar Republic founded on Western democratic traditions. The communist imagined they could ally with Hitler's Nazi movement, gain power, and then dispose of the Nazis. They were wrong. Ultimately, the Weimar Republic couldn't withstand the assaults, and Hitler was swept into power.

Today's Antifa is much more closely related to the WWII Axis powers than to WWII American GIs and their values, institutions and traditions."

Maybe only certain people are truly empathetic, but don’t ever tell me empathy is false or “made up” because it is not. Worst empathy you can feel is someone you know, is a friend, and is losing their spouse to terminal cancer. Yes it does hurt badly and if empathy is t real, I…..

Nosy yellow-press shits at best, nefarious intelligence assets at worst.

Ever wondered why professional athletes are covering their mouths while communicating on the field when their match just ended? 
They wouldn't give two flying fucks about what's being said being known.

They just avoid the fairy-tale-yellow-press-bullshit that anonymous ""lipreaders"" could make out of every 3 or 4 sentence small-talk-exchange. 

They just don't want to deal with that shit.

Few(!) lipreaders are skilled (the skilled ones aren't ever working for media tho) - the vast majority of what is called ""lipreaders"" – not so much. Nefarious.

Rule of thumb: if they are named = tiny chance of being credible

""Anonymous"" = full of shit 

The (mainstream) media is the **Enemy of the people**.. never forget that - and never let your guard down!

He crossed a line when he claimed Tyler Robinson was MAGA, even if it was clear at that point he was far left.

Imagine Greg Gutfeld claiming that Martin Luther King was killed by a black civil rights activist. Not as a joke, but as a serious claim.

Gina Carano was both fired and blacklistet for a far less serious ""crime"". Kimmel had the whole entertainment industry on his side.

This is not about Kimmel, but Trump and MAGA. By allowing him to return, the leftists and woke celebrities feel they will have won a victory towards Trump, which they for some reason believe is responsible for the cancellation."

I’m all for words having employment consequences when crossing the threshold of celebrating murder or condoning it. But what he said in his monologue didn’t. The “joke” was detestable and tone deaf in its own right, but he didn’t rejoice or rationalize Kirk’s murder. He’s said plenty far worse things that should’ve sparked more outrage and put his show on thin ice previously. So let the guy’s show continue…The few dozen viewers left will tune out and his ratings will do the job of ending his show for him."

He’s smart because as much as he says he’s hated by the far left, his liberal audience has been locked in for many years, and now, because he’s not totally psychotic, he’s growing a center/right audience. Add his podcast in there and he’s doing well with a wide spectrum of viewers, all while most of his left wing talk show colleagues are crashing out. The guy is shrewd so good for him."

He had good things to say about Trump when he went to the white house a few months ago and hung out with him for a day off-camera.

From what I understand, he's been very welcoming and cordial with Republicans when they are on his show. No traps or landmines set up. Just an honest talk.

Edited to add: If you are going to watch or listen to the other side to see where they stand, listen to Bill. I hate to say it, but I think he is actually with the majority of the Democrats that are actually living and working around us. The crazy far left is a minority in the party but the elected officials in the Democrat party cater to the nut jobs."

So I watch CNN a lot and this past year or so they have really made a solid effort to not only be all about trump is hitler. Obviously still there but it’s the best I’ve seen.

It's an incredibly sad state of affairs, but when someone doesn't have a moral core to have actual standards, and when children raise each other on Internet forums instead of being raised by their parents, this is what happens.

1nntatv,nfnmup1,Erika's eulogy.,2025-09-22 19:57:52+00:00,-1,"I was saying a couple years ago that we live in a post-debate America. Charlie Kirk, a better man than I, didn’t believe that, and he tried.

The best use of one’s energy is to advocate for tangible changes in the nation. This can mean running for a local position like school board, donating time or money to conservative politicians, joining Turning Point, or anything in between. It can also mean starting by really educating yourself as to the history of something like critical theory (to understand what they’re doing), following politics, and brainstorming with like minded people (here or elsewhere) about strategies to effectuate positive change. 

But debating with the left or being perturbed by what they have to say is a waste of spirit. It should be full steam ahead with the conservative agenda. The implementation should be swift and merciless (see: designating Antifa a terrorist organization, sending ICE to Chicago). Ignore their screeching, and roll forward like a locomotive, while their shrill screams fade into the background. We can win, but it has to start now, and all the Mike Johnson-style bullshit talk should be a relic of the Republican’s flaccid, tepid past."
1nntatv,nfrmw20,Erika's eulogy.,2025-09-23 13:52:49+00:00,-2,"So I’m def in enemy territory here so I’m ready for the influx of hatred haha. I’m a very left leaning person and I will say, I’m not a fan of how the far left is acting about this death. Now that being said I’m very much a I still left. I firmly believe they have no obligation to feel bad for what happened considering the man spent his life lobbying against the rights of the ones who are cheering. Think about it this way, let’s say a lefty activist that set out to take away some of your rights was killed in the same manner, I’m willing to bet that a good portion of you would cheer and the other portion would not. That’s exactly what’s happening here, not all left of cheering this death, just the extreme ones. Both sides have them. They don’t have to feel bad, but they also could just let you mourn without being thrown a bunch of insults, not a great look for the left, and that hurts me. Like if you have nothing nice to say just stay quite is my thought. 

I’ve noticed something in the meme culture. From left memes get violent in the aspect of talking about “kill the billionaires” but the right has significantly more violent memes directly at just normal every day left. For example I’ll see a meme from a far left praising Luigi for taking out a billionaire, but then I’ll see a far right meme about “getting a new paint job” for thier car and it’s a pic of a car running through protestors killing them spilling blood all over the car, hence the “new paint job”. Far right wing/MAGA historically speaking, if you look into it, are a much more violent group of people when it comes to what they post. I’m not saying you shouldn’t be allowed, but I don’t think it plays into effect for what you are seeing right now. 

Both are vile, both are hate directed, both lead us to where we are now. You can’t blame the other side without looking at what you have done as well, the same goes for the left. 

What I’m saying is, we both kinda suck so let’s get off our high horse and let’s figure out a real solution aside from taking out the other side completely. How to go about that, not a fucking clue…..🫡"

1nouofb,nfuuew1,It's so true thougj,2025-09-23 23:19:36+00:00,5,"I agree. Wokeism and cancel culture were effectively against free speech. The way we suppress voices that don't agree with the majority is likely a significant factor in why Republicans gained so much traction, as it was really suffocating. Free Speech should allow for men like Socrates, ideally, to offend and challenge the norm. 

Yet the shortcomings of the liberals do not mean that republicans, who purport to stand for free speech, can just decide to repress it all the same because it offends them.  It is hypocritical. Also, to add to this, the way that cancel culture functioned is that it was a mob rule sort of thing- it is not better- but republican suppression of free speech has been sanctioned by the government and supported by the government. I find both distasteful, but the latter far more sinister. 

Whataboutism is a load of nonsense. He did this so I can do that. Yes, liberals are flawed, but are you here to repeat the same damn mistakes? Rise above this bullshit"
1nouofb,nfyl5h4,It's so true thougj,2025-09-24 15:13:41+00:00,2,"I think we need to pass stronger laws protecting free speech, especially in the private sector, because it isn't private anymore when the government can and regularly does compel social media companies to censor or a business fires a person because some activists blow up their phone e lines, depriving them of their livelihood because some snowflakes cant handle a tweet. 

If you lose your job because of what you say in your private life, do you really have free speech? 

And I'm talking about the likely tens of thousands of essentially nobodies that have been canceled over the past decade because leftists call up their places of employment to get them fired and destroy their livelihoods. 

We arent a socialist country with free healthcare and housing, loss of income means no healthcare, no housing, no car, no food, etc. 

It's literally life threatening."

As a whole they first decided nope we're not going to pass this,  then discussed how they'd all vote to get the result. How many times has a bill passed or failed by one vote ? Too many for it to be a coincidence, they're playing us. 


Longer version... and the odds are astronomical 


Let \(n\) be the number of people voting. In this case, \(n=427\).Each person has two possible choices: voting yay or voting nay. For the first person, there are 2 outcomes.For the second person, there are 2 outcomes....For the 427th person, there are 2 outcomes. Since each person's vote is independent of the others, we can use the multiplication principle to find the total number of outcomes. Total outcomes = (outcomes for person 1) * (outcomes for person 2) * ... * (outcomes for person 427)Total outcomes = \(2\times 2\times \cdots \times 2\) (427 times)Total outcomes = \(2^{427}\) This is a very large number, and calculating its exact value would be complex without a computational tool. However, the number of outcomes is simply 2 raised to the power of the number of voters. So, for 427 people voting yay or nay, there are \(2^{427}\) possible outcomes."

Are you ignoring the fact, that **there has not one shred of evidence RFK Jr. provided to support his claim** that Acetaminophen causes autism. **NO DATA** showing the outcomes of women who took Acetaminophen during pregnancy, versus those that did not. **Acetaminophen a generic drug with no patent claim on it, providing low-cost NON-ADDICTIVE PAIN RELIEF** for pregnant women.

**AND YOU** are arguing, well lets blindly follow any politicians orders: Obama, Biden, RFK. If a politician ordered you to jump of a cliff would you jump? Stop cosplaying as a conservative."

Meanwhile, they had no issue when Reddit, mainstream media, and the major social platforms silenced countless conservative voices for far less over the years. Something something “implied rhetoric” versus openly calling for more murders.

Honestly, I think they’re plants because no one could be more useful to future conservative campaigns than having fascist, pro-assassination voices out front representing the other side."

There are no studies that definitively prove any sort of link between Tylenol and autism

There **are** studies that ***claim*** ""Tylenol may cause autism if taken while pregnant"", but that is the **best** that can be stated. Why? Because that's just not how that works.

The job of an objective scientist is to weigh through all the bullshit and come out with a clear conclusion. Weighing both sides of this (there are studies that go both ways, people), there is not enough evidence to draw the link between autism and Tylenol / acetaminophen . There just **aren't**.

Trump also used 'Amish' to back his claim up. I mean, ***AMISH*** of all people. Do you have ANY clue how many differences there are between that group of individuals and those of us living in cultured society? WAY more than just ""We don't do Tylenol""

I've said it before, I'll say it again. It's claims like this that make Trump (and the right) look batshit fucking crazy. He needs to just stop

Most of these weren’t formal wars to begin with—more like border clashes or diplomatic disputes. In each case there were temporary cease-fires or talks, but no verified, lasting peace deals brokered solely by Trump.

I am not a democrat so I can concede that Hilary and Pelosi for sure at the bare minimum belong in jail for their crimes, but let us no pretend that there aren't a plethora of republican politicians who should rot in hell. Our whole system is governed by an elitist, corrupt sector. 

I find it ironic that jail gates? For his connection to Epstein? I mean, I would certainly agree with that. I find it funny, leftist and republicans should agree that there is a clique of ultra-wealthy who influence are politics. It is just we disagree on who it is and what are solution to it should be. I agree that Soros and other figures like him are malicious, but when republicans make these bold statements yet ignore Musk's blatant election interference (using the same methods as Soros) it is praised. When we suggest taxing the billionaires, it is ""unamerican,"" not our city on a hill. The truth is we have been separated, we both hate the same fucking people and we need to stop hating on each other.

1nqeyy8,ng6anhn,Trump plotting to fire thousands of government workers,2025-09-25 18:44:19+00:00,3,"Donald Trump is planning to fire thousands of civil servants if the US is plunged into a “government shutdown”.

The White House told government agencies to prepare for mass redundancies if Congress fails to pass a funding bill by the Sept 30 deadline, in a hardball negotiating tactic.

Under US law, Congress must pass [12 bills a year](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/12/20/trump-backs-us-government-shutdown-says-bidens-problem/) to keep the government funded. When it fails to do so, federal agencies end all non-essential functions until senators and representatives can finally strike a deal.

In most of the previous shutdowns, federal workers have been temporarily furloughed and returned to work once Congress voted to restore funding.

But Mr Trump is striking an uncompromising stance with Democrats, warning that they will become the face of mass redundancies as they try to reverse cuts to healthcare programmes as part of the negotiations.

The US president was scheduled to meet with Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, the Democrat leaders in the Senate and House of Representatives, on Tuesday, but shortly before the shutdown, said he had changed his mind.

“After reviewing the details of the unserious and ridiculous demands… I have decided that no meeting with their Congressional leaders could possibly be productive,” Mr Trump said.

According to a memo from the Office of Management and Budget, the government will sack workers in federal programmes that are “not consistent with the president’s priorities”.

“We remain hopeful that Democrats in Congress will not trigger a shutdown and the steps outlined above will not be necessary,” it added.

1nrfenh,ngev1vc,"Trans people, how they are harmful",2025-09-27 02:01:15+00:00,16,What you're doing is spewing the leftist talking points. That's not anything that we have set on the right. We don't care what trans adults do. We do care if they go out in assault or kill someone. Which is happening. And we care what liberals do to little kids trying to make them into a different sex. So get your story right.
1nrfenh,ngf6sm6,"Trans people, how they are harmful",2025-09-27 03:19:49+00:00,5,"The biggest problem is that many trans supporters have tried to force this into schools with young children to get children who are too you to think for themselves to choose a different sex than they are, and they even tried to do it in a way that kept the parents from being involved. That's immoral and disgusting.

If someone wants to live that way, it's their business, but forcing it on little kids is twisted."
1nrfenh,ngf16xn,"Trans people, how they are harmful",2025-09-27 02:41:40+00:00,4,"Most of us don't see them as harmful. We do find the hypocrisy of the left bothersome - since they are quick to say straight males are extremist, and then cancel anyone who hints at being uncomfortable with the thought of a trans person.


I find the whole trans thing as a condition stemming from either child abuse, lack of fulfilment, not getting a sense of belonging in society, not finding a mate, or a feeling of lack of productivity in this society. I can see how easy it is to blame yourself and create a form of deep depression that leads someone to believe it is their personality in the most natural form that is the issue . I think it is odd that the whole speed running community is a majority trans. It doesn't make any sense that certain subsets of society has a higher proportion of people being trans compared to the general population. That is why I think it is an issue not feeling as part of the in group of society - psychologically speaking.



Now what pisses me off is that instead of addressing the root of the problem(a society problem) politicians on the left and medical professionals would rather pump their clients full of drugs and reckless surgery to make a quick buck. The trans medicinal industry is absolutely massive and it blows my mind that half this country is in total support of it instead of trying to determine a societal solution"
1nrfenh,nghaseh,"Trans people, how they are harmful",2025-09-27 13:55:12+00:00,2,"I dont care what people do as long as they dont involve OTHER PEOPLE......OR KIDS!  Its that simple. IMO, the 'non harmful' trans people are the ones we never hear about because they mind their own business and arent online screeching about pronouns and grooming kids. All they want is to fit in and not draw attention to themselves. I have seen quite a few trans people out in public here and there, and none of them acted like we see on the internet. Nobody cares about those people being trans. Its the unhinged ones that cause problems and are harmful, its like that in any group of people. There are down to earth ones, and there are unhinged ones.    As far as what religion says about that, I dont care because I am not religious. What I care about is live and let live but here is a good point to consider.......trans people want to be accepted for who they are, but dont accept themselves for who they are and start chopping things off their bodies.....that is not self acceptance! Dont ask people to accept you for who/what you are when you dont accept yourself for who/what you are."
1nrfenh,ngexwbs,"Trans people, how they are harmful",2025-09-27 02:19:45+00:00,2,"I don’t think they are any more harmful on average than anyone else. 

Re: statistics I’ve heard it said they overrepresent in political violence and that they don’t. Someone could post accurate credible statistics."
1nrfenh,ngjc4n8,"Trans people, how they are harmful",2025-09-27 20:15:56+00:00,1,"""Transgender"" is a Marxist term. The ""theory"" of gender as a construct was created by a [sick psychologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Money) who abused children in order to prove that gender was learned and not a factor of genetics. (his experiments on children proved him wrong)

In the early Gay Rights movement, Trans**sexuals** (those who have gender dysphoria) were distinguished between Trans**vestites** (those with a fetish, often sexual, for wearing opposite sex clothing or passing as the opposite sex in public). The Marxists have conflated the two under the same heading ""transgender"". They are *not* the same thing.

A trans**sexual** may be a man who may have reassignment surgery and wish to marry a man. In the past a transsexual would have been loath to expose their male genitals in public in any way.

A trans**vestite** may be a man with a fetish for flashing his genitals in a woman's only space, like the YWCA changing room. I consider any MTF (male-to-female) trans**gender** who engages in sexual relations with a woman to be a transvestite, not a transsexual.

I have suggested above, two harms of the trans**gender** movement. One is to effectively erase the experience of true transsexuals. The other is to fight for the rights of a sexual fetishist to practice their fetish in public."

Gavin Newsom made a law that says you cannot wear face mask if you’re a cop

With Biden countries felt emboldened to do what they want knowing the US wouldn’t react which is why we saw Russia go into Ukraine and Hamas on October 7th and Israel reacting the way they have. 

With Trump as president there is a fear factor the US would do something that would affect them.

Here’s a concise, single-sentence summary for each of the seven conflicts you asked about:

* **Cambodia–Thailand (July 2025):** Trump’s direct calls and trade-pressure threats broke the deadlock and led to a Malaysia-brokered ceasefire within a day.
* **Kosovo–Serbia (2025):** Kosovo’s president credited Trump with decisive intervention that prevented escalation and secured a ceasefire.
* **Democratic Republic of Congo–Rwanda (June 2025):** Trump personally mediated and was present at the Washington-signed peace accord, acknowledged by U.S. officials and both governments.
* **India–Pakistan (May 2025):** Trump’s overnight diplomacy and phone calls brought about a full ceasefire, publicly praised and Nobel-nominated by Pakistan despite India’s political denials.
* **Egypt–Ethiopia (2025):** Trump engaged both governments over the Nile dam dispute and was publicly credited, especially by Egypt, with averting a threatened war.
* **Armenia–Azerbaijan (August 2025):** Trump witnessed and was central to the Washington joint declaration and initialed peace text that halted fighting.
* **Israel–Iran (June 2025):** Trump personally brokered and announced the ceasefire after direct strikes, with U.S. and regional sources acknowledging his pivotal role."

If you are so much about being a democrat, go run to become a representative. NOT take your opinions to the streets. Why the fuck are you here on reddit? Go to Congress!

It's always this kind of bullshit every single time. The more someone claims he is an adherent to democracy, the less likely he wants to make use of mechanisms of that democratic government to push for political changes. 

Go for a Congressional testimony, or get someone who can get testified and write to him. There you go. Freedom of speech."

The Biden administration used lawfare to try to bankrupt and jail political opponents. 

This is just off the top of my head.

This post is complete bullshit as it pretends that everything that is going on now didn't happen in previous administrations etc.

Trump, as POTUS was PERMANENTLY BANNED from social media and we were told ""private companies cannot censor and can make whatever business decisions they like"". However , we know it was actually government that directed this. Jimmy Kimmel was taken off the air for a matter of days and reinstated. What happened to private business decisions?

Plenty of third party analyses show this. And plenty of other outlets are still reporting, even with their agendas. No threat there.

Kimmel was fired because his ratings have been tanking badly for years, now that he’s alienated over half of the country. Advertisers don’t want to pay to advertise if no one’s watching, which threatens the viability of the stations, secondarily threatening their employees. 

Your leftist buddies have lost the plot, and are now defending and promulgating violence, illegal immigration, rioting, etc. Mob mentality and groupthink are also being pushed by social media, like Reddit. If any of us (conservatives) dare try to post something that’s pretty clearly common sense, we get banned. 

Murderous leftist behavior is taking root- Charlie Kirk. Recent ICE agent murders, doxing, and on and on. There are several dozen examples of this in the last few years.

We’re no longer looking at Dem vs Rep and negotiations to meet in the middle. 

We’re now at good vs evil. I still believe that as Americans, we will persevere, and I refuse to write off the left. We’re all Americans.

And all of the news media is owned by the same people. These are the people who have pitted us up against Islamic countries so that we fight Israel’s wars for them

Yes, some of them will chant stuff like “death to America” but why do you think that is?
It may be because we have invaded their countries and murdered a million civilians based on a false flag agenda and Netanyahu “weapon of mass destruction claims which turned out to be bullshit. 
In islams books Jesus is actually a prophet, and they support Jesus.
In Israel’s books Jesus is a false idol. And I have countless videos of them saying that people who worship Jesus a false idol should die. I have videos saved of these same people spitting on Christian’s and attacking them.

What does the gospels say?  ""Where there is a carcass there the vultures will gather.""  Doublespeak is the same way.

If that same mod happens to see this, I have to ask: did *you* Google it? Can you counter any of these points and back them up with receipts?

**1. Cambodia ↔ Thailand**

* Agreed to an “immediate and unconditional” ceasefire after diplomatic mediation involving the US, Malaysia, China, and ASEAN... and since then there have been multiple reports of ceasefire violations. Conflict paused, not resolved.
* [Source1](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/ceasefire-takes-effect-between-thailand-cambodia-after-five-day-border-battle-2025-07-28/)

**2. Serbia ↔ Kosovo**

* This conflict is mostly diplomatic/legal and low-intensity in recent years rather than active interstate war. Fact-checkers say there’s little proof that Trump played a decisive role in any major de-escalation.
* [Source1](https://www.factcheck.org/2025/08/addressing-trumps-claims-about-ending-multiple-wars/)
* [Source2](https://www.wral.com/story/fact-check-did-trump-help-stop-6-wars/22122852/)

**3. DRC ↔ Rwanda**

* The DRC and Rwanda signed a peace agreement mediated in part by the US and other actors. As of September, Rwandan troops have not fully withdrawn and implementation stalled. Meanwhile, violence in the region (especially involving rebel group M23 and other armed groups) continues.
* [Source](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/sep/23/donald-trump/trump-ended-seven-wars-un-general-assembly/)

**4. Pakistan ↔ India**

* Cease-fire violations were reported soon after the call with the Trump Administration, and accusations flew from both sides of breach. India later said it had simply “paused” operations rather than fully conceding a negotiated peace.
* [Source](https://nbr.org/publication/the-may-2025-india-pakistan-conflict-neither-quite-the-same-nor-quite-another/)

**5. Israel ↔ Iran**

* Trump and Qatar mediated a ceasefire (or at least a cessation of hostilities) effective June 24, but since then both sides have been accused of violating the ceasefire or engaging in episodic strikes afterward.
* [Source](https://zeteo.com/p/mehdi-hasan-debunks-trump-claim-ended-7-wars)

**6. Egypt ↔ Ethiopia**

* Currently there is no comprehensive peace agreement covering all issues. Fact-checkers see no strong evidence that Trump “ended” it.

* [Source2](https://www.wral.com/story/fact-check-did-trump-help-stop-6-wars/22122852/)

**7. Armenia ↔ Azerbaijan**

* Of the list of seven, this is one of the better cases for “ending” conflict, but it's still early and no deal has been fully adopted. Armenia says it’s ready to sign the deal and Azerbaijan says Armenia must remove its claims to Azerbaijani territory from its constitution, which could be rejected by Armenian voters.

That alone shows he has not spent time here or talked to any of our residents.

Calling our city “run by Democrats” is wrong. Do a little research and you will find that our mayor, Amer Ghalib, openly supports Trump and was even appointed as U.S. Ambassador to Kuwait under the Trump administration.

The pride flag ban applies only to public property. Walk down Joseph Campau or through the neighborhoods and you will see plenty of pride flags flying on private property, in storefronts, and in local business windows.

The City Council has never said the ban was about opposing LGBTQ+ people or “gay lifestyles.” Their stated reason was to keep government expression neutral by not allowing any non-governmental group’s flag on public poles. A federal judge agreed the rule was constitutional and content neutral. Private residents and businesses can and do continue to fly the Pride flag as they choose.

Do I agree with the ban? No. Would I agree with someone flying a Knights Templar flag next to a Pride flag on a city building? Also no. It is a double edged sword because once you allow one non-governmental flag on public property you have to allow all of them.

Hamtramck is obviously not just Muslim. We have a huge arts and music scene and people of many backgrounds who coexist peacefully. The city is far more diverse and vibrant than outsiders realize.

In a city that is over 50 percent Muslim it is hardly surprising that the City Council reflects the community that elected it. That is democracy at work.

I have lived in Newark and New Orleans and despite this person’s obvious Islamophobia Hamtramck is one of the safest dense urban neighborhoods I have lived in. It is far more diverse and welcoming than the headlines suggest.

Maybe try doing some real research and at least learn how to pronounce the city’s name before coming online to preach about a place you clearly do not understand."

But the public executions still ongoing today for more serious crimes."

Its the mods - They have literally nothing else to live for over there

I'll never forget the first time I saw Jesse Waters from Fox News - It was on here, lol. On Reddit. He interviewed the mods from the AntiWork board; And it was absolutely hilarious. That was years ago. Then, I started doing my own research into reddit. 

Not only is it majority bot-traffic - But, reddit has a lot of paid interests as well. - It is a propoganda tool, that failed miserably. It was supposed to unite a group of avid, computer-science-orientated, political opponents, for the right - But, it just ended up being a cesspool of corporate interests like any other bigger social media platform. 

I love to see reddit trying to stop all of the actual thought. Because, they cant. They do try though - Through means of banning, using bot accounts to bolster specific posts to the frontpage. It's so trivial and childish, when you think about it. ""If we don't control narratives, then how will they be convinced that our idiotic methods will work!?

Anyway, I experienced both sides which made me realize, the Democrats hate Trump because he keeps winning the arguments.  He keeps being right, and the Democrats thought they had a monopoly on rightness. It's like a Reddit argument for them, they just want to win and humiliate the other side at the same time.  How the world should be is not up for debate, according to them.  Trump is winning and forcing them to have this debate, instead of dismissing the other side like they'd prefer.  Many Democrats still refuse to admit Trump's legitimacy and the fact that half the country supports what he says and does.  They want to dismiss him as racist (when he's only against DEI), and transphobic (when he's protecting women's sports), and a nazi (when he protects our borders), etc.  Sorry to rant, but we need to take up the enormous task left by Charlie Kirk. Confront them with confidence and make intelligent arguments, keep forcing them to have this debate, for the sake of our country and our freedom. 🇺🇸

He has been in business a long time , had a successful business , is good at negotiating and has lived through years and years of unprecedented litigation, lies and attacks.

I never knew how hard it was to go thru a court case, how much time it takes , how much money it takes , how much nerve it takes and how much life it takes out of you. I have to admire anyone who can survive what he has. 

It's very odd for me to see people support towns being burned down, cars being stolen, murderers getting away with, the United States in debt... No problem. But let immigrants (not vetted, not immunized) get free housing, credit cards, phones, poor Americans get nothing and then when they are committing crimes, visas over and millions and millions of dollars spent to defend them.

Hassan Mahmoud Hassan Hussein orchestrated the massacre of 16 Israelis from a roadside bomb shelter, where partygoers fled after terrorists descended on the Nova music festival. 

The commander, who served in Hamas's Bureij Battalion, also oversaw the kidnapping of four hostages, including Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who later died in Gaza.

Hussein was killed in a recent airstrike in the Gaza Strip, the IDF announced.  Muhammad Abu Attawi, the other Hamas commander who helped carry out the roadside murders was killed in an Israeli strike in October 2024.

1ntl5t7,ngx5gro,At least they care about privacy,2025-09-29 23:53:53+00:00,1,"Very interesting but we need more studies. We’ve learned that basically everything we do or consume has a link to various cancers, so this is not surprising that a seemingly innocuous OTC medication has a potential link to autism. There’s likely many other environmental factors involved that haven’t come to light yet. But pregnant women and young infants are limited to Tylenol for fevers or pain because it’s the only safe option, especially for pregnant females - most others are teratogenic. I’m all for Trump, but I fear well-meaning parents may swap to NSAIDs instead, which are very dangerous under 6M (kidney issues, GI bleeding, etc) or even worse, products with aspirin which can be catastrophic to kids under 14 (I’ve had young kids with life-threatening liver failure from aspirin), so I was hoping the administration would emphasize that during their address to the nation…Again, we need additional retrospective studies regarding dosage and frequency taken during pregnancy or infancy to get a better idea of the connection. That being said, based on limited options for pregnant females or young infants, if they come to me for a fever, I’m giving them Tylenol as it’s the lesser of two evils. That being said, respect to Trump for actually giving a crap and reviewing J&J, a company most other politicians would never dream of touching."

Please, actually enlighten us with whatever we would do by default that resulted in even more misery, even more conflicts, even more poverty, even more strife in Africa for the past several decades.

""Hurr bring in the Africans to USA!"" Yes, deprive Africans of their most talented ones. That'll be sure to modernize their nations! World peace is achieved when everybody becomes stupid and poor!

""Hurr give them food!"" That goes straight to their warlords.

""Hurr give them jobs!"" What jobs? Oh, right, hyper extractive raw resource jobs because 'ArBiTrAge'

""Hurr interfere with their elections and support 'democratic' leaders!"" Do you even know what democratic means? The people of Africa decide, not you.

Every single neoliberal attempt at being 'humanitarian' to other nations had alwys resulted to further misery in the long term. You lot simply couldn't be bothered not to turn everything into a zero-sum parasitic interaction, even when it comes to saving human lives. Everything has to be about profit. 

You had your shot when the world listened to you lot on guidance on resolving foreign conflicts. You blew it in Mali, you blew it in Afganistan, you blew it in Burma, you blew it in Ukraine and most of all....you all blew it in Palestine.

So shut up and stop preaching about what USA should or should not do."

I decided I don't give a shit anymore, you can't let it get you down. they're mad they couldn't successfully swing the election by limiting trump posts,.and now are even more angry he's doing things that are positive for our country.


also, I reported about 100+ comments promoting violence (charlie kirk sick asshole saying how they wish he would have been shot with a bazooka etc...) **NOT ONE OF THEM WAS TAKEN DOWN** and some were so horrible I don't even want to repeat them/remember them. yet, things like this happen. I've been muted from my state/city sub on multiple occasions for saying things exactly like you, yet the left is allowed to say the worst of the worst and it's a free pass for them. maybe if I joined an anti-trump subreddit I'd get my ""scammer"" status taken down, but like the first post says, take it as a badge of honor.

This just shows you’re missing my entire point. The fed is setting a hard cap for the amount a state can get. So even if you are legitimately eligible, you can still be cut because the fed didn’t set the cap for that state high enough. 

I just don’t understand how people can justify cutting anyone’s health care. It shouldn’t be attached to employment or social status. I bet you’re someone who pays out of pocket and that’s why you don’t want anyone getting handouts. Get over that mindset and care about your fellow Americans. 

If we had universal health care where government sets the prices on services/pharma, we’d end up spending less than we do just to cover Medicare and Medicaid right now. It would stop big pharma and insurance companies from charging 5k for an ambulance ride or 20$ an ibuprofen."

I've also heard about the large Muslim populations in Dearborn (as shown in this post) and Minneapolis.

Don't let America become Islamified like Britain. Islamic values are not compatible with Western values. Maintain your Christian heritage. 

Luckily you in the US have such vast land and the facilities to stop Islam from spreading everywhere. We're just a small island and we're getting overrun.

The entire island of Great Britain is about the same size as just the state of Oregon, England (being hit by it the worst) the same as that of Alabama.

Don't be complacent. Do your best to educate the Left on the dangers of Islam, even if it's likely they won't listen. They'd rather attack Christianity. How naive of them."

The Republicans passed a clean CR that kept spending levels at current levels until November 21. There was much screeching, wailing and general sphincter clenching by the democrats about the impending death of millions of people getting handouts from the government.

1nvlfnl,nhcy9o8,Why is the government being shut down?,2025-10-02 13:14:36+00:00,9,"Okay so what the Republicans are saying: *""Democrats won't vote on the budget because they want healthcare for illegal immigrants, its* ***THEIR FAULT!""***

Yeah okay. Obviously that's true, its a fact. But is the government shutdown *really the Democrats fault?* Lets do a deep dive. 

1) The Democrats are refusing the sign off on the annual **""Continuing Resolution""** (CR) to approve the current budget. **( The budget that was made in .... 1997, and has been CR'd every year since)**

2) Remember when Republicans did this to Obama and **shut down the government?** Most Republicans forget.

**Congressional Republicans refused to sign a continuing resolution (CR) during the Obama administration, most notably leading to a 16-day government shutdown in October 2013**

  
3) So lets go back to that 1997 budget. Congress is responsible to create new budgets. Have they since 1997? Nope. Is that concerning? Well, it should be. CR's are just a negotiating tactic for Republicans & Democrats to use whenever they want. 

I work in mortgage and now guess what I have to do? Hear it from all the government workers who are on furlough from the shutdown and give them forbearance plans (If they qualify) and its unnecessary hardship that people have to go through. 

They can't pay their bills, they can't feed their kids, they default on their credit card payments. It's awful, **even missing 1 paycheck can set you behind on everything**

 ... and yeah ***""Today""*** it's the Democrats fault, but I went through the same thing when it was 2013 and it was the Republicans fault. 

Who's fault is it really? **Every congress member who sat on their ass since 1997 and didn't create a new budget.** Because of that ... they just kick the can down the road with a CR.

 Think about it. They focus on so many bills and issues except the most important one ... ***Our budget.*** 

I blame *all of them*. I'm not buying into this finger pointing he said / she said bullshit."

Democrats will say that they are doing to it protect Medicare and Medicaid rights as these have lost massive amounts  funding due to the big beautiful bill. Now they definitely blocked the vote for the funding bill, but I believe they had good intentions.

Republicans will say that it is because the democrats want to give a trillion dollars worth of Medicare to illegal immigrants. Which I dont believe is true because in order to qualify for either medicaid or Medicare you need to have some proof that you are legally in the United states.

TLDR: I dont know if I'm 100% right on the terms, but essentially, dems wanted to get funding back for health care after republicans cut it and they could reach an agreement. 

It all depends on who you ask. I definitely dont like the attitude that either side is giving because both sides are playing the blame game."

That is how the Appropriations process has worked for decades. Speaker Johnson and Majority Leader Thune said NO MORE. 

Speaker Johnson passed a clean CR to give themselves more time to finish up the Apropriations Bills in Regular Order. Schumer invoked the filibuster rule which now equires 60 votes to get back to the floor to vote on the CR. The CR is clean. No spending increases, no spending decreases just an extention of the date to get the Appropriations Bills done. Last year they voted on final passage of the budget in Dec.

1nvlfnl,nhhj2v2,Why is the government being shut down?,2025-10-03 03:42:36+00:00,1,"This is the answer to the question: government is being shut down because Congress has not appropriated funds. 60 votes are needed in the Senate to approve a budget. Democrats stated reasons are they are trying to use their ""leverage"" to reverse some of the cuts to health care that were passed in the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" act--which was passed as a reconciliation bill. It did not require 60 votes in the Senate. 
  In truth, this happens every year--and both sides are hypocritical.
  The Dems say it's for health care. It's not. They're making a statement. It's hypocritical. The Republicans say it's funding illegals. It's not. That's already illegal. The Republicans aren't even presenting a budget. They're literally asking Democrats for a ""continuing resolution"" of a budget they all universally opposed in 2024. 
  This will not change until we the people demand better from our lawmakers. Personally, I would have preferred the Republicans just define their budget priorities and make the Dems defend why they're opposed. Then they could hash it through. And both Vance and Jeffries/Schumer are equally at fault.

This has been an issue since well before Trump was in politics, but under Trump 2.0 and with the pace of changes this year, congress has actually decided to try and regain some of it's authority.


The talking point for the current shutdown is ""healthcare"" or ""funding the illegals"" depending on who you ask, but that is all just smoke and mirrors and happens to be the issue that both sides are using as cover.


The real issue is the question: ""Has the executive branch grown too strong? Is congress no longer a coequal branch?""

They only care in so far as it prevents payments to their constituents for things like SS or VA benefits. 

Both sides believe it is politically advantageous to shut the government down. For Republicans, because democrats won’t agree to make even minor cuts, and for democrats, because republicans are refusing to fund something that may benefit someone. There’s a belief from both sides that they can on the blame on the other side and use it to garner more support and votes in the midterms.

1nvkld6,nhbquhb,Michigan house bill 4938,2025-10-02 07:13:39+00:00,1,"Yeah, that bill is real, but it’s also way over the top. It basically tries to ban porn, ban anything showing crossdressing or trans people online, and even makes VPNs illegal if you use them to get around the filters. The punishments are ridiculous — huge fines and up to 25 years in prison. That’s straight-up authoritarian.  

Legally though, it almost definitely wouldn’t hold up. The First Amendment protects most sexual expression and also protects LGBTQ+ identity and self-expression. Courts have struck down way less extreme laws, so this would almost certainly get tossed.  

There’s also a chance it’s being used more as a political stunt than something meant to survive in court. Kinda like how in 2017, a Texas lawmaker introduced that “anti-masturbation” bill — the one that would’ve fined men $100 for ejaculating outside of a vagina. That wasn’t serious, it was satire to protest abortion restrictions. This bill feels like it could fall into the same bucket: loud, shocking, and unconstitutional, but not actually enforceable."

How funny would it be if Omega, for example, just make a press release...., ""OK, we sell about 40% of our watches inside the US. In order to evade these tariffs we have purchased 11 acres in Montana where we will build a factory to produce around 250,000 watches per year with 100% identical quality to what you're used to from Switzerland. The only difference is that they instead of saying ""Swiss Made"" at the bottom, they'll say ""Made in USA."" We will be hiring about 1,500 people. And oh... by the way, those price increases are going to be rolled back the minute we break ground. In fact the MSRP on all products are going to be 10% lower in US made watches than Swiss watches.""

The reaction of the American watch buyers would be this... ""UGHHHH I can't believe they're doing this! This is terrible! Trump is awful!!! END THE TARIFFS!!!""

And you know why? Because the Swissness of their watches is what they want. So even if the tariffs did exactly what Trump intends, in a market that is dominated by foreign goods from foreign countries, even if they add to the American work base and lower prices, and even if there is no loss in quality... they STILL won't be happy.

It was a “gentleman’s agreement “ that no president would serve more than 8 years, until FDR was elected during the depression and just continued to run(and win) for 4 terms thru WWII until he DIED in office. After that the congress said “16 years in office is kinda like a King” and produced the 22nd amendment.

Add on top of that the increasingly deranged and violent rhetoric erupting all across the platform, with literal threats of death and destruction becoming more and more commonplace by the day, I can definitely see how getting a message like that could be cause for serious concern. We can no longer take comfort in writing off the activist left as all bark and no bite - many of them could still be like that, but after recent events, it would be foolish not to take their threats of harming others seriously. The epicenter of the national mental health crisis has long fallen mostly upon the far left spectrum. Unfortunately, the far left is no longer quite as marginalized or fringe as it used to be - or at least not on internet echo chambers like Reddit. As such, one has no choice these days but to assume that the vile, toxic, hate-spewing words of any given ""progressive"" Redditor is potentially serious, with potentially grave consequences for simply ignoring them, as was previously the best option."

I will point out that this sub, like most political subs, is full of hateful rhetoric and and demonization of the other, and it is spewed with glee. I hope everyone asks themselves, am I part of the problem or part of the solution?

I have to kind of laugh...I have made a few posts here and very quickly given the label as ""deranged"". Apparently, all I had to do to get that moniker is have opinions of Trump that differ from the majority on this sub. That's too bad--what is desperately needed right now is connection, conversation and empathy, none of which is really available on this sub. But hey, if one of the first thing people that run this sub do is label and denigrate the other with these monikers, I guess I shouldn't accept much.

Like most political subs on here and on the Internet in general, this sub is nothing more than an echo chamber for like minded people, and the content is primarily hateful, vindictive, and bullying. It's pretty sad. I guess that is the world we live in now? One finds this on BOTH sides. I personally have tried to interact with people in good faith and with an open mind on this sub, to no avail. 

Luckily, I am somewhat removed from the current meth lab fire that is America right now--I am not American--though my folks and the rest of my fam were originally from NH. I am quite sure that, contrary to your President's wishful thinking, we will never, ever be the 51st state. Hopefully y'all work things out.

I'm not sure why I keep seeing posts like this everywhere on Republican subs. I suppose it's the narrative the Trump Administration is pushing to pressure Dem Leaders to cave on ACA subsidies and Medicaid funding by framing it as “healthcare for illegals,” even though that’s not actually what’s on the table. Dems want to keep health care affordable for people who are already legally eligible. There is nothing about giving free healthcare to undocumented immigrants."

I also said most members of Antifa have bodies like mushy potatoes stuffed in black garbage bags.

Ostensibly “conservative” subreddits have removed some of my other (equally mild) commentary.

Which means literally anything they show up at the hospital for but go into the emergency room. There is no difference between severe or minor or what's a ""true"" emergency. Pregnancy is also fully covered if they go to the emergency room to drop their anchor baby.

1nxcars,nhn91ia,A message for MAGA from the Pope.,2025-10-04 01:08:24+00:00,7,"1- The Vatican City is a decadent shithole, extremely far from the prosperity and splendour of the original Rennaisance-era Papal State it once was. It is a relic, a has-been, one last tiny dot of the Roman Empire that just refuses to die. It has no credibility on trying to poke holes at the massive juggernaut that is the USA.

If the Vatican popes are so wise in their judgements surely their intellect would be reflected in the end result on the prosperity of the Vatican. Is it actually a shining beacon of wealth, high wealth equality, intellect, philosophy, culture? Not by a long shot.

This is like trusting someone who never fixed a car in his real life to lecture mechanics how fixing is done. Preach, Simplicio, preach.

2 - Inhuman treatment of immigrants? Oh? Give names, Pope.  
Conflating legals and illegals are you? Let me tell you something, Roman. There is a classical Latin term for this logical fallacy: **fallacia aequivocationis.** Cicero and Quintilian disapproved of this. As the last bastion of Roman identity in this 21st century you should know this more than anyone else.

Not to mention thaat leading with a loaded question and a false accusation condemns yourself into the logical fallacies of **complexio** — the *complex question* that smuggles guilt into its very wording — and **petitio principii**, begging the very conclusion you claim to prove.

You speak as though accusation were evidence, as though repetition were truth. This is not Roman *ratio* but Greek sophistry dressed in white robes.

Shall I remind you, Roman, that the true heirs of Cicero, Quintilian, and Seneca would have scorned such tricks? To conflate, to load, to accuse without proof — these are not the weapons of reason, but the toys of rhetors who know their case is weak.

3 - To follow up from 1 and 2, slander is a grievous sin under Roman Christianity, as so is the sin of minding other people's business where you do not belong. For what is it but **superbia**—pride—to raise yourself as judge over households and nations not your own? What is it but **otiositas**—idleness—to busy yourself with the speck in your brother’s eye while your own house is crumbling into dust?

* **Leviticus 19:16** *“You shall not go about as a slanderer among your people, and you shall not stand up against the life of your neighbor: I am the LORD.”*
* **Thessalonians 4:11–12** *“Aspire to live quietly, and to mind your own affairs, and to work with your hands, as we instructed you, so that you may walk properly before outsiders and be dependent on no one.”*

I have said my piece, and so Simplicio, sometimes the act of greatest wisdom is to shut one's mouth when he is not the right speaker of the room."

These are blatant lies and gas lighting and they are using the government as their way to misinform and blame the other side.

They keep saying dems want Medicare/medicaid for illegals or undocumented immigrants, but that law already forbids that. What they really mean is the budget for the emergency care act funds which Reagan put into law so that hospitals wouldn’t turn away people that needed care in an ER without insurance. They want the shutdown - the administration (Russ V) already said that they want to use this to again cut more services and more federal workers permanently. With almost no workers you have no functioning government anymore. When you have no more functioning departments or checks against the president then you can just take over and do what you want. Again this is how governments and democracies fall to dictators. Is this what you want? Look at other sources besides Fox News or even news outlets not under Trumps thumb."

1nx6ptp,nhne862,Three time Trump voter. Can someone please explain to me why AIPAC is a good thing and why we should support Israel??? Genuine curiosity,2025-10-04 01:42:50+00:00,4,"AIPAC is important because it is one of the most influential pro-Israel lobbying organizations in the United States, advocating for policies that strengthen U.S.-Israel relationships

One of the reasons we support Israel is the world’s radical Islamists, from Iran on down, have made no secret of the fact that America is the “Great Satan” to Israel’s “Little Satan.” Just as Nazis once cried out, “Today, Germany; tomorrow, the world,” today’s Islamists are open about the fact that theirs is a war against the West. Israel is the first, not the last or only target.

In other words, supporting Israel is in America’s best national interest."
1nx6ptp,nhn4j94,Three time Trump voter. Can someone please explain to me why AIPAC is a good thing and why we should support Israel??? Genuine curiosity,2025-10-04 00:39:14+00:00,5,"I’d suggest reading some of the history of Israeli/Muslim conflicts over the last century. More times than not, the Israeli’s have come to the table to make peace with their Muslim neighbors, only to be attacked in bad faith. If you look at the entire history of the region (that we know of), it is clear that both Jew and Muslim have claim to the region, yet one side wishes to live peacefully together and the other wishes death to all Jews. It’s a huge ideological and religious chasm that our watered down Western culture cannot begin to understand. 

The current situation is tragic, but the propaganda surrounding it is downright disgusting. The Jews were ATTACKED by Hamas (and hostages taken), therefore their response is justified in my opinion. We were attacked on 9/11 and invaded Iraq and then Afghanistan. Did they call America’s response a genocide? And Hamas, knowing Israel would respond, built their militant network underground beneath civilian targets. They knew that they could gain international sympathy, that, in order to attack them, the Israelis would have to also attack a school or hospital. And their plan worked - the sheep ate up the propaganda designed to paint Hamas and Palestinians as victims, when they’re the ones who started this conflict in the first place! They are STILL holding hostages that they took from October 7th, and have refused every deal put forth to get them released. 

Then you have global powers at play, with Russia funding proxy attacks by the Iranians and Hezbollah trying to find ways to destroy Israel at every turn. Do they not have the right to defend themselves? Israel has literally been defending its right to exist since 1947 when the UN split then British-controlled Palestine into separate Palestinian and Jewish states. 

Of course, seeing starving children and visceral attacks are horrifying, but this is the reality of WAR. Hamas has also been known to hoard food supplies and deny access of humanitarian aid, probably to further the cause of gaining international sympathy for their plight. 

The question is, do you believe Israel has the right to exist? If you believe yes, then that is why we continue to support them. Without the U.S. backing, Israel would be wiped off of the map by its Muslim neighbors."
1nx6ptp,nhnvv4g,Three time Trump voter. Can someone please explain to me why AIPAC is a good thing and why we should support Israel??? Genuine curiosity,2025-10-04 03:47:49+00:00,4,"I’m gonna give a more blunt perspective. Yes, AIPAC is a foreign lobby group and their money should be taken out of DC. Most lobbyists should be taken out of DC but that probably isn’t going to happen. 

Gaza is a horrendous situation but Hamas kinda started a war. War is absolute hell and I wish it would end immediately but how is war supposed to be conducted? We dropped two nukes on civilian population centers last time the main land was attacked formally by another nation. After 9/11 we killed half a million people in the Middle East. I don’t like it, no one should but if Mexican cartels supported by the Mexican government crossed into California and slaughtered attendees of Coachella and then raided homes in San Diego, what do you think would happen to Mexico? 

Lastly, Israel is essentially an American aircraft carrier permanently docked in the Middle East. Again I agree, they have too many fingers dipping in DC that I want out. We send them $4 billion too much every year for defense but at the end of the day, those are Israeli lives dying and defending their home. 

If they controlled us like so many claim, why are they dying and getting hit with missile fire, drone strikes, and fighting in the streets while we argue about a federal shutdown with memes? 

I support the Israeli people as allies, Bibi thinks too highly of himself and I’d like to see what new leadership looks like in Israel. At the same time I can’t blame them for wanting to destroy their enemies. If we followed that doctrine, we wouldn’t have needed to stay in Iraq/Afghanistan for 20 years. Destroy your enemies with unrelenting force and get out. 

All in all, Israel is our lapdog in the Middle East. We send them a rounding error of our budget to keep our military industrial complex making money stateside. Tats American jobs, and we get to test our fancy new platforms out there in a real life scenario. Again, I don’t like it. I really don’t, it’s sick and my heart aches for the children of Gaza and the sons and daughters of Israel but that’s war. We should avoid it at all costs and thank God Trump is trying to end as much war as possible."

They've been invaded many times and the minute they ""go soft"" they're done for.
It's debatable how much the US should support them financially, but there are a lot of Jews here too who pay a lot of tax and want to support Israel. We also sell a lot of weapons to Muslim countries too e.g. Saudi and Turkey who need to be deterred from attacking Israel."

 ""...one immigrant underwent a sham marriage with an elderly American who was then subject to “elder abuse and exploitation,” according to Fox News.

Another immigrant admitting faking a Kenyan death certificate for $100 to end his marriage when his wife, who is also the mother of five of his children, was living in Minneapolis.

USCIS also found the son of a suspected terrorist who overstayed his visa and had been denied benefits because of fraud.

The sweep took place between Sept. 19 and Sept. 28""

""...less than a two-week period, that’s only the tip of the iceberg to what we’re actually dealing with when it comes to immigration fraud. That ultimately is, in my opinion, the same thing as a threat to our national security...""

Hypothetical: If a mob of illegals kicked down your door, moved into your home, and then started to dictate new house rules (while law enforcement and government officials watched, snickered, and did nothing), would we say that you deserved it? Would your wife and children deserve the chaos, abuse and disrespect? *That, gang, is California*. 

There are millions of good people there, many of which are multigenerational California families who’s roots run deep. They don’t deserve this.

As someone who lived in the Golden State and knows its politics well, I often wonder what the Congressional map would look like if they cleaned up the voter rolls, had voter ID, and ended sanctuary cities.

That’s not what immigration is for me! I want to make this country better, I want to do my part and contribute! If other people use my taxes and are able to get their heads out of the water, I’m happy I did my part to help! But coming here to leech off is a big no-no to me!

Instead, they chose to make a stand over whether a tiny group of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) holders — less than 0.4% of the U.S. population — should be allowed access.

Meanwhile, MAGA farmers are finally realizing that Trump’s tariffs against China backfired, slashing their export markets and forcing them to take billions in federal bailouts — the very “government handouts” they used to rail against. Free market until it hurts them, socialism when it saves them.

This administration has made one thing crystal clear: it does not serve working people — only billionaires and special interests.

So maybe it’s fitting that if this bill doesn’t pass, and healthcare becomes even less affordable, people will finally see the cost of blind loyalty. Racism and bad economics are expensive. The question is: can you afford them?"

A population that can be thrown in prison for speaking their mind. Trump is making our country great again and protecting our constitutional rights. And making our citties safe again when given the opportunity. If you support the progressive movement, you do not support what it is to be American, and the freedoms our great veterans, including founding fathers fought for."

1nwskz4,nhl7p0y,I’m really wondering why…?,2025-10-03 18:20:14+00:00,-1,"Ok I’ll share my opinion. I did grow up a conservative Christian. That being said, yes some immigrants don’t have good intentions, I am a USA American that was an immigrant in a different country for 10 years. I didn’t break laws and finished my education. That being said, “illegal” immigrants… maybe I have empathy for people who want a better life for their family, just like my family did… and depending on circumstances I don’t feel it is right to kick out families to a dangerous country. Obviously people genuinely breaking laws by murder or kidnapping… they shouldn’t even be free in any country if they’re doing that… being a Christian ties in… because in my head… like God created the earth… for humans, we are all equal to him. Then we draw lines in the sand and whine when someone crosses it. And I know the rapture was trending again, you’d think with all the red flags that DJT has that you wouldn’t give him the eyebrow thinking he might be the antichrist. (Side note: my mother whole heartedly believed that Obama was the antichrist and that the rapture was happening soon) to me, if Christian’s know their Bible they shouldn’t spew hate to other groups of people, no matter the differences. MAGA doesn’t have much grace for differences from what I have seen. This is what makes me curious. I still haven’t found good answers for my question, it’s okay."

1ny9747,ni9y9bn,Why is Trump so hard to ignore compared to other presidents?,2025-10-07 17:02:35+00:00,1,"As to why Biden and Obama weren't ""out there"" in the media as much, there's basically 2 reasons.

The first is that while the right couldn't stand either one of them, they didn't live rent free in our heads for 12 years. So we didn't make EVERYTHING about them.

The second thing is the transparency of Trump's presidency. We didn't hear shit from Biden for 4 years and Obama did everything in secret. Trump on the other hand has meetings constantly and invites the press to everything and answers questions from everyone. You call it hungry for attention but I call it being transparent and open almost to a fault."

1nz2mzt,nhz6vu3,Give a THUMBS UP if you remember!,2025-10-05 23:06:12+00:00,25,"I was just thinking about this.  If you have a low enough income, you qualify for a government handout health insurance, and also, if you have a low enough income, you don't have to pay a penalty come tax time that's called your ""fair share"" of the healthcare burden, if you don't have insurance (in my shit ass state, hopefully your state is more sensible).

The thing is, most middle class people make more than would qualify for the public assistance, but also less than the penalty cutoff, meaning the government thinks you make too much for them to help you have health insurance, but also that you don't make enough to afford it on your own.

Both of these numbers are invented by the same government, who simultaneously admits you don't make enough to afford health insurance, but also that you make more than the cutoff that they're willing to help.

But illegal aliens get a 10k gift card and free healthcare, an amount that could cover three legal citizens health insurance.

And congressional Democrats are fighting to keep this.

Because that's what their constituents want."

1nz2mzt,ni112pm,Give a THUMBS UP if you remember!,2025-10-06 06:50:55+00:00,12,"This is BS. Illegal aliens have never been eligible for Medicare or Medicaid, ever (the coverage for non-citizens here legally is too complicated for me to understand). The only thing Dems want w/regard to illegal aliens and healthcare is to rescind the cuts made to hospital reimbursement for emergency stabilization. 

Watch this:
https://twitter.com/i/status/1974851326510330252

That is Speaker of the House Mike Johnson saying that Dems want to spend 1.5 trillion dollars on health care for illegal aliens. And he says it's right there in black and white in the text of the bill, and he gives you the page and section number!!! ""Don't trust me, look at Chuck Schumer's own paperwork.""

He knows you won't do it. How can you not trust his Boy Scout face? But you really should go to his website (speaker.gov) and read that page. But you won't, so I did it for you. Here's the entire section he says has all the details:

""SEC. 2141. REPEAL OF HEALTH SUBTITLE CHANGES.
9 Subtitle B of title VII of the Act titled ‘‘An Act to
10 provide for reconciliation pursuant to title II of H. Con.
11 Res. 14’’ (Public Law 119–21) is repealed and any law
12 or regulation referred to in such subtitle shall be applied
13 as if such subtitle and the amendments made by such sub14 title had not been enacted. ""

That's it? That's it. He knew you wouldn't fact check him. He depends on it. There's nothing there about spending 1.5 trillion on health care for illegal aliens.

And when he gets a little push-back, he backs down immediately. Well, maybe there's nothing there about spending 1.5 trillion on illegal alien health care, BUT, his budget office projects the subtitle the Dems want rescinded may save almost 200 billion. So his first claim was only off by 1.3 trillion.

So what is it really about?

Under a law passed by the Reagan Administration (and still in force), illegal aliens (nor anyone else) cannot be refused to be seen by a hospital emergency room if their life is at stake, even if they can't pay. Hospitals are required to give indigents, legal or illegal, ""stabilization"" care, which means just enough medical attention so they don't die on the spot. THAT IS STILL THE LAW. What the OBBB did was severely cut the amount of reimbursement the hospital gets from the government for this treatment. That doesn't stop illegal aliens from getting emergency treatment, it just stops the hospital from recovering its costs, with the result that many rural hospitals will be forced to close if this isn't changed. The Dems want to restore the reimbursement amount to the previous level, so more hospitals can stay open (although some will still close because of the other cuts to Medicaid). It is Trump's own constituency that will be helped the most by this, because big city hospitals are less likely to go out of business than rural hospitals.

Again, illegal aliens are still required to be treated for life-threatening emergencies. That part of the law did not change. The money in question goes not to them, but to to the hospital that treats them. They will still get the treatment whether the hospital is paid or not, the only question is how long the hospital can afford to stay open if they're not paid."

She probably thinks his death will stop his “hate speech” and will keep people safe.

If she’s open to it, have her watch the ENTIRE Charlie Kirk episode with Trans activist Buck Angel. Charlie treats Buck with respect, gives Buck the space to share the message he wants to convey to Right, and engages in conversation about gender dysphoria, and the importance of Trans rights, and their shared agreement on keeping kids safe from gender altering drugs and surgeries until they are of age. 

Both the left and right media and news outlets are guilty of quoting out of context, and altering coverage to rage bait and keep us at each other’s throats.

I'm pretty sure most leftist felt the same, and didn't hate him for his political views but instead for his homophobic and misogynistic views."

Yes, Candace takes things very far, but she reports facts, then draws her wild conclusions based on those facts.  Tucker just reports on facts.  Both of them agree that the leadership of Israel is NOT off the table.  

There is a HUGE difference between blaming the jews and blaming the government of Israel and calling them dishonest (which they are).  Believe it or a large portion of jews hate the current leadership of Israel.  Don't buy into the propaganda machine that says if you don't like Israel you are antisemitic, it's bull.  I hated the Biden Admin but never hated all Americans.

So Candace has every right to call the gov of Israel corrupt and evil.  It is not being racist and it's only the lies we are sold that try to connect the two.  Agree with her or disagree with her but don't buy into this garbage."

1o02yjr,ni7645m,Trump Just BROKE Demon Slayer Fans,2025-10-07 05:19:56+00:00,3,"Many demon slayer fans are americans, hence the $70m opening weekend. So trump BROKE americans. Making fans pay more money for foreign made movies isnt going to make people happy. It's not like foreign made movies take jobs away from americans. And it's not like most movies released in america are foreign made movies. Ultimately this hurts the movie industry more than it helps because it produces less variety of what we see in america. 

Also what does a tariff on foreign made movies mean? Because its not like foreign made movies have a set price that can then be increased. Is he talking actual production on movies made outside american? Because a lot of american movies are partially made outside of america. I mean LOTR was made almost entirely in new Zealand. Or are we going to tariff movie tickets for those movies? In which case we end up with higher prices of those movies. 

Ultimately it makes ZERO sense to tariff something that doesnt even physically exist and then provide no context as to how you want to do it. IMO trump saw demon slayer(one of the most popular manga/anime ever) do better than american films and wanted to fix it, but its not something he can fix because its not up to him and there is nothing to fix."

Altogether, their presence adds roughly $40–45 billion to the U.S. economy each year and supports hundreds of thousands of American jobs in education, housing, retail, and local services. Because most international students pay the full sticker price, their tuition revenue often helps universities subsidize lower tuition rates for in-state or domestic students and fund scholarships, research, and campus facilities. This spending not only strengthens universities financially but also boosts the economic vitality of college towns and surrounding communities.

If you voted for the trump administration I advise looking into how it has ACTUALLY delivered on the things ya'll thought were important. If you really think that 1.5 T healthcare funds are going to fraudsters then you are gravely misinformed. Do some research on what your party has done for you instead of listening to mainstream media (Fox, CNN, etc.) talking heads who want to manipulate you."

People don't even want to diet and lose weight. It's entirely possible. Look at the intermittent fasting subreddit. thousands of people who made a decision to better their life and health.

1o1aau9,nik06ol,The American Dream,2025-10-09 06:28:05+00:00,2,"Teach the basics of finance and business in school. Most people leave high school with no idea how capitalism actually works, which leads to them not realizing the problems with systems like communism when they get to college, as well as not knowing how to invest their earnings and work toward becoming financially independent one day. They then blame 'the system' for all their problems, never learning how they can use 'the system' to get what they want, nor understand the damage they do to their future with frivolous spending. 

In the current system, if you have parents who are well-educated enough to teach you these things, you have a huge advantage over people from, for example, low-income families who have no experience with things like loans, credit, stocks, bonds, capital appreciation, enterprise value, etc. This leads to a situation where poor families tend to stay poor--not from lack of social mobility, but from ignorance. 

Democracy works best with a well-educated population."

What would the same bot say if you asked it? Probably something like this? 

If it were entirely up to me, no committees, no politics — I’d say: probably not in the running, at least not yet.

Here’s why, candidly:

The Abraham Accords were significant and positive, but they didn’t fundamentally resolve the underlying regional conflicts — they were more pragmatic normalization deals than true peace settlements. They improved relations but didn’t address the Palestinian issue, which remains the central flashpoint.

Peace prizes, ideally, should go to people or organizations that create sustained de-escalation and cooperation, not just temporary détente or transactional agreements.

His style of diplomacy — personal, unpredictable, often zero-sum — did sometimes shake up stagnant systems, but it also destabilized others. That’s not necessarily anti-peace, but it’s not Nobel-level peacemaking either.

On the global stage, his withdrawals from multilateral agreements and use of economic coercion (tariffs, sanctions) tended to increase tension in as many places as they eased it."

1o2he0f,nircwo0,Trump Nobel Peace Prize 2025 or 2026?,2025-10-10 12:10:17+00:00,1,"Whether or not someone thinks Obama deserved his Nobel, Donald Trump should never get one, and it’s not about politics, it’s about principle. The Peace Prize isn’t supposed to be a PR trophy for photo ops or “brand diplomacy.” It’s meant to honor genuine, sustained work toward peace, human rights, and international cooperation. 

Trump’s record is the opposite of that. He withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal (which increased global tension), greenlit the Yemen arms trade, tried to pressure Ukraine for political gain, and normalized personal diplomacy with dictators while undermining long-term alliances. Even the Abraham Accords, while positive, didn’t end any active wars, they were mostly about formalizing relationships that were already quietly in place.

Beyond foreign policy, his constant rhetoric of division,calling opponents enemies, undermining institutions, and fueling domestic polarization, stands completely against the spirit of what the Nobel Peace Prize represents. You can’t promote peace abroad when you stoke chaos at home.
And also the way he has been roaming around saying this and also his constant need to remind people he deserves noble prize makes it almost seems like he is begging for it. If your goal to make peace around the world is to get noble prize then sorry that's not a good leader's sign. People can downvote me or bash me (if you reasonable debate points I am open to it which is rare in  both left and right wing leaning subreddit!!)
In short: whatever one’s opinion of Obama or the Nobel committee, giving the Peace Prize to Trump would make it a punchline, not an honor."

I don’t consider it an insurrection for multiple reasons. I also believe every person arrested has had their lives ruined even with a pardon so when people talk about justice in the sense these people were let off I roll my eyes. 

Protesters in the summer of love caused billions in damage and most of those people walked away. Antifa was part of that. Antifa continues to agitate, commit violence,  destroy and vandalize. In Portland the courts are letting most of these people walk. In Seattle Antifa shows up to Christian public prayer meetings and causes problems and the local government blames Christian’s for the problems."

“When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and for the witness they had borne. They cried out with a loud voice, “O Sovereign Lord, holy and true, how long before you will judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?” Then they were each given a white robe and told to rest a little longer, until the number of their fellow servants and their brothers should be complete, who were to be killed as they themselves had been.”

1o3cfrz,nixeb1z,It was just a month ago today an assassin took Charlie Kirk from us...Rest in Peace Brother,2025-10-11 12:00:51+00:00,3,"Charlie’s assassination has been revealing.

The Left showed where most of the “hate” actually resides in our modern society. It confirmed all of the “coexist”, “love” and “end hate” bumper stickers are really just ideological virtue signals and not representative of underlying principles.

The pastor at the church I attend spoke about division and the harm of social media, but intentionally avoided saying Charlie’s name, or speaking about him, even if only to recognize his Christianity. In the midst of pure evil, some churches, maybe many, are more afraid of losing attendance than find the courage to provide moral clarity.

Charlie wasn’t a Saint, as most of us aren’t, but in a world that has grown so cold and so afraid, it is impossible to deny I have more respect for him now than I do of those who would only see him for his sins or those who won’t utter his name out of fear of offending someone. 

Our world needs more Charlie’s, and his legacy, I hope, will be to give others courage to live louder than the noise of teeth gnashing and deafening silence of cowards."

There’s certain people on our “team” that have figured out that they can make a lot of money, throwing out wild ass, conspiracy theories about certain ethnic groups, exploding microphones, air rifles, even super Mario tunnels..

Sad part is that it seems to be propagating.. 

I’m the first one to admit I love a good conspiracy theory. But these wacky theories that have absolutely no basis are diverting the attention from the problem which is the absolute radical left deciding that violence is going to be their tool to keep the world in check.

Let me know when Chuck Schumer or someone who, you know, actually has some power says something like this.

What's ironic is that Republicans with real power, like the Speaker of the House, said something very similar to this about Democrats. There will be a big ""No Kings"" rally next week, but Johnson calls it the ""Hate America"" rally, and says that the millions of people who will participate are ""pro-Hamas and antifa."" It's just despicable.

1o3b0of,nj0ovhg,Left crying that a proTrumper won Nobel Peace Prize,2025-10-11 23:20:57+00:00,2,I heard that he couldn't have won anyway because he wasn't able to put the application in at the right time.
1o3b0of,nittvs0,Left crying that a proTrumper won Nobel Peace Prize,2025-10-10 19:49:27+00:00,1,"Yes, María Corina Machado has publicly expressed strong support for Donald Trump, particularly praising his policies and actions aimed at opposing Nicolás Maduro's regime in Venezuela and supporting the Venezuelan opposition's push for democracy.
For instance, upon winning the Nobel Peace Prize on October 10, 2025, she dedicated the award in part to Trump, stating: ""I dedicate this prize to the suffering people of Venezuela and to President Trump for his decisive support of our cause!""  She has described his approach as ""courageous"" and ""visionary,"" and emphasized that Venezuela counts on him as a key ally for achieving freedom and stability in the region. 
This support dates back further, including:
Congratulating Trump on his 2024 election victory and affirming that a democratic Venezuelan government would be a ""steadfast ally"" to his administration. 
Thanking him for measures like limited oil waivers and actions to ""dismantle the criminal and terrorist structure"" in Venezuela, positioning him as a partner against threats like drug cartels and regional instability. 
Expressing gratitude for his ""unwavering support"" during her detention and other challenges, calling it a ""turning point"" for her safety and the opposition's efforts. 
Praising his administration's ""firm and decisive action"" against Maduro in earlier years, including during his first term. 
Her statements consistently frame Trump as a vital supporter of Venezuelan freedom, security, and economic opportunities, such as turning Venezuela into an ""Energy Hub of the Americas.""  While her support is tied to Venezuela-U.S. relations, it has been explicit and ongoing across multiple public platforms."

So it was completely unilateral and the only hand the Democrats had to play with shutting down the government. So let me know when a true negotiation in good faith is offered to the Democrats. They still represent at least half of the voting public so it doesn't seem smart to completely ignore that many people.

🇺🇸 The U.S. trained Ukrainian pilots on American bases under U.S. command.
It was temporary training, not a foreign-run base on U.S. soil.

🇶🇦 The Qatar plan in Idaho is different — it’s a dedicated facility for a foreign military inside America.
That raises real questions about sovereignty, oversight, and legal jurisdiction.

And let’s be honest — even Trump-world isn’t cool with this:

Steve Bannon: “There should never be a military base of a foreign power on the sacred soil of America.”
Laura Loomer: Called it an “abomination” and said she won’t be voting in 2026 over it.

Boeing already has contracts to service Qatari F-15s and train pilots — that part isn’t new. What’s new is where the training happens.
Bringing it onto U.S. soil changes the legal and security landscape completely.

And let’s be real —

“172,000 jobs” and “trillions” are talking-point numbers, not verified projections.

Most defense-training programs create a few hundred to a few thousand support jobs, not an entire city’s worth of employment.
Plus, the jets, parts, and maintenance are still Qatar-funded and foreign-operated — the profits don’t all stay here.

If this deal is as great as claimed, release the contract details:
	•	Who controls the base?
	•	How many Americans are actually employed?
	•	What percentage of revenue stays in the U.S.?

Until that’s public, the “jobs and trillions” line sounds more like PR spin than national strategy."
1o48iyj,nj31pv0,🇶🇦 Qatar is building a “training facility” inside a U.S. Air Force base. Why are we okay with this?,2025-10-12 10:58:25+00:00,1,"There  are allegations and some evidence of ties between individuals in Qatar (or Qatari-based actors) and terrorist funding or facilitation — though “Qatar the state” being directly complicit in 9/11 is not proven in any public, gravity-accepted legal finding. Below is a breakdown of what’s known, what’s alleged, and what remains disputed:

⸻

What is documented or alleged

1. Alleged connection via Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (KSM) and Qatar employment
	•	Some sources claim that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the architect of 9/11, was once employed by the State of Qatar and received safe harbor there.  ￼
	•	There are accusations that while he was in Qatar, he had protection or patronage from Qatari officials or connected elites.  ￼
	•	However, most mainstream and commission-level 9/11 investigations do not place the blame on Qatar as a state actor for the 9/11 attacks.

2. Qatari-based financiers and terror-funding allegations
	•	Khalifa Muhammad Turki al-Subaiy, a former employee of the Qatar Central Bank, is designated by the U.S. as an al-Qaeda financier. He is accused of transferring funds to KSM and other extremist groups.  ￼
	•	Madid Ahl al-Sham, an online fundraising campaign based in Qatar, was cited by U.S. authorities as a conduit for donations to Jabhat al-Nusra (al-Qaeda’s Syrian branch). The campaign was shut down by Qatari authorities in 2014.  ￼
	•	In Qatar, some charities have been accused of being front channels or having links to extremist groups (e.g. “Eid Charity” has been scrutinized)  ￼
	•	Qatar has also been accused (by other Gulf states and in academic / policy analyses) of providing refuge to or failing to sufficiently crack down on extremist financiers or intermediaries.  ￼

3. State-level criticism and U.S. concerns
	•	The U.S. has repeatedly criticized Qatar for its lax enforcement on counterterrorism financing, particularly in handling non-profit organizations and charity oversight.  ￼
	•	In U.S. congressional testimony, some analysts have urged that Qatar more aggressively act on terror financing.  ￼
	•	In a 2008 case, a Qatar­-linked individual was charged and convicted in absentia by Bahrain for terror activity; he was later arrested in Qatar but reportedly released after ~6 months.  ￼

⸻

What is not proven or remains unverified
	•	No credible, broadly accepted public investigation or court ruling has established that Qatar as a government orchestrated or directly enabled 9/11.
	•	Many of the allegations depend on secrecy, financial opacity, intermediaries, or intelligence leaks and are often contested.
	•	The distinction is important: individuals or NGOs within Qatar may have been implicated; that is not the same as state policy endorsement or direction."

To be a fighter pilot in a Gulf State, you're probably a royal  or close to the royal family.  They aren't putting their pilots in a regular base officers quarters.  They will build a facility to fit their religious and cultural activities.  It will probably be opulent inside.  They will have their own chef and food, living quarters, a mosque,  gold tiolets, or whatever.  One day  they will leave, and the facility will be retained by the US Air Force."

🇺🇸 Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar is an American-controlled facility on foreign soil.
It’s under U.S. command, U.S. law, and U.S. security oversight — we pay the bills, we call the shots.

🇶🇦 What’s being proposed in Idaho is the reverse: a foreign government’s military personnel and assets operating on our soil. That’s a first in U.S. history.

Allied cooperation abroad ≠ foreign basing here.
Hosting U.S. forces overseas expands our reach.
Allowing foreign forces here blurs sovereignty, jurisdiction, and national control.

If this is truly “just training,” then publish the agreement — spell out:
	•	Who’s in command
	•	Who owns the land
	•	Who holds legal authority if something goes wrong
	•	Who pays for it

Until those details are public, calling it “just like our base in Qatar” is misdirection, not reassurance"

Qatar’s government wasn’t proven to plan 9/11, but multiple Qatari nationals were sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury for funding al-Qaeda and related networks.
That’s not a “theory,” it’s federal record.

So yeah, say thanks GPT all you want — just remember:
Reality doesn’t bend to hashtags or faith-based PR."

Bannon: “There should never be a military base of a foreign power on the sacred soil of America.”
Loomer: Called it an “abomination” and said she won’t vote in 2026 because of it.

So if they’re furious, is it still “manufactured”?
Or are you just fine with foreign governments getting a foothold here as long as Google says they mean no harm?

Because real conservatives don’t take national security on faith — they question power, foreign or domestic."

A few thousand terrorists were never going to conquer Israel on their own, and as far as we can tell it wasn't coordinated with Hezbollah or Iran, so expecting their allies to join in was a gamble at best.

The liberals love to lie and demonize people here and make us into something that we're not. You'll learn bit by bit that MAGA is full of the most accepting people who you don't have to  agree with on all things. You'll also realize that liberals are always willing to cancel their own over anything. It's completely insane how they deal with disagreements in their ranks.

1o4vu23,nj60puy,Former liberal moving towards MAGA. Advice on acceptance wanted.,2025-10-12 21:01:32+00:00,27,"You are already ahead of the curve, because you actually realize the biases against you. I would continue talking with people here and your cousin. Start forming a relationship with her, so that she can answer any questions you may have. 

  
The best advice I can give you is to go over every political issue and write down your stance. Don't try and make assumptions if those stances are good/evil or if others will treat you poorly. You need to know where you stand on many issues. They won't be completely in line with conservatism (or liberalism), because nobody is 100% on board either party, despite what the media wants you to believe. Once you get a firm grasp of your own beliefs, then you can look into the pros and cons of each belief. It's possible some beliefs you currently hold might swap one way or another when you perform some unbiased research. 

If you come out completely in the center between both parties, then that's fine as well. What I've noticed is that many people who are/were liberal are afraid to move slightly away from the partly line. They have been told what to believe, and they rarely have to think for themselves to develop their own beliefs. They have been led to believe that if you are a 'centrist' you are a coward and just as evil as nazis who didn't actively fight against other nazis. 

But it's alright to have differing beliefs from liberals and conservatives. Heck, as a British person, you most likely have very differing beliefs from most conservatives and Trump supporters. But that's alright as long as you don't try to force them on others (specifically with threats of violence and shaming). Trump and most of his current staff were all democrats a few years ago. People change, and you need to surround yourself with friends and family that can accept you for who you are."

I started voting all-Republican then but mostly as protest against Democrats.  It took me probably 4 years, maybe more, to get rid of all of the Democrat brainwashing and realize that I'm actually more conservative than liberal.  The one big issue that still put me in liberal territory was abortion, and after researching exactly what happens during that procedure I switched sides and am quite anti-.  I'm female, I don't buy the excuse that abortion is a woman's way of controlling her body, if you get pregnant and you didn't want to be pregnant you've lost control.  Easier to use contraception."

**Several comments-**

1. The LEFT loves to paint MAGA as a cult; says we worship Trump, etc. That is BS. Do I and many others of MAGA find him to be a bombastic a-hole? YES! There are times when his personality and his ramblings about himself get quite tiring (ex. CK's eulogy), but I love it when he is an a-hole towards the MSM.  
  
There are a number of things with which I disagree with him on. But all in all, more of his policies align with mine vs. the Ds. In fact, few or NONE of their policies align with my values.

2. With your cousin, tread carefully.

3. Expect your lefty friends who preach ""tolerance and acceptance"" to angrily disown you! It happened to me. Just LOOK how they **celebrated** the assassination of a man with whom they disagreed and even called for violence against his wife! **They are literally a cult.**"
1o4vu23,nj6eurt,Former liberal moving towards MAGA. Advice on acceptance wanted.,2025-10-12 22:21:12+00:00,1,"Honestly, I’m convinced leftism is sort of a cult. A cliché, but hear me out. It’s large enough that there’s room for people to participate to varying degrees, but everyone in it has one shared lens through which to view the world: oppressor/oppressed, distinctions of race, gender, etc. Everything is susceptible to being “problematic”, and your opinions must live within a certain window or you’ll be cast out. 

When I finally realized Donald Trump wasn’t the second coming of Hitler, it felt like taking off foggy, oppressive glasses. I was finally free to see the world as my parents and grandparents (though ours is quite messed up in important ways) saw it and lived in. It’s like taking off a weight of hysteria and feeling free to feel happy again. Just because terrible things are happening, doesn’t mean you should make every second of your own life miserable. Live a good life, work hard, spend time with those you love and work towards making the world better.

Anyway, sorry about my little ramble. Welcome!"

So despite what some headlines might imply, the answer’s still “no"" undocumented immigrants do not get government benefits. Always has been.

1o4rnd2,nj4479a,Trump pays troops amidst gov shutdown,2025-10-12 15:15:42+00:00,13,"Trump is doing what he does best. 

The Democrats have repeatedly used government shutdowns as a political weapon rather than a legitimate policy tool. Shutting down the government doesn’t solve problems.. it hurts ordinary citizens, delays services, and undermines trust in the system.

Instead of negotiating in good faith, they’ve chosen obstruction and drama to score political points.

Trump’s position emphasizes accountability and efficiency, keeping the government running while addressing disagreements through proper democratic debate, not by holding the country hostage!"
1o4rnd2,nj4e0i7,Trump pays troops amidst gov shutdown,2025-10-12 16:06:01+00:00,2,"The troops should be the first to get paid, what type of incentive is it for those that protect our country to maybe get paid if the government is running?

Also, how the fuck are there not measures in place for times when all of these retards in office can’t do the single thing they were appointed for? Making a decision. In these scenarios each collective party should draft their own proposition for the bill in question. This should then be kicked out to the public for voting similar to an election well in advance of the government being shutdown. If they can’t do their jobs at least give us, the people, a chance to do it ourselves. In the meantime not a single politician should be permitted to leave their post for anything aside of emergencies. If they do, immediate termination similar to…Idk a normal fucking job like we all have?!

It’s so exhausting seeing these politicians from both parties think they’re some type of larger than life entity while forgetting they are supposed to be representatives of the Americans that elected them."

The lead for Jay Jones in the Virginia Attorney General race shifted notably after the text messages were revealed on October 3, 2025. Based on the most direct before-and-after comparison from the Cygnal poll (a Republican-leaning firm, with consistent methodology across waves):
•  Pre-scandal (September 7, 2025 poll): Jones led incumbent Jason Miyares 46.4% to 42.5% (+3.9 points), with 11.1% undecided.
•  Post-scandal (October 6-7, 2025 poll): Miyares led Jones 45.8% to 43.7% (-2.1 points), with 10.5% undecided.

This represents a net swing of 6 points against Jones. An “informed” ballot question in the post-scandal wave (after explicitly presenting details about the texts) showed a slightly larger drop, with Miyares leading 46.4% to 40.0% (+6.4 points), with 13.7% undecided.
Other polls provide context but less direct comparison:
•  Pre-scandal polls (late September/early October) from independent sources like Christopher Newport University’s Wason Center (Jones +6) and Trafalgar Group (Jones +3.8) showed similar leads.
•  A post-scandal internal Democratic poll by Hart Research (October 4-6) showed Jones still leading 46% to 45% (+1), suggesting less erosion.

No public post-scandal polls include partisan crosstabs to directly measure shifts among Democrats specifically. However, pre-scandal crosstabs indicate Jones’ support was overwhelmingly from Democrats (e.g., 96% in the Wason Center poll, 83.7% in Trafalgar), with independents more split and minimal Republican crossover.

To extrapolate retention among previous supporters: The Cygnal poll’s drop in Jones’ support from 46.4% to 43.7% implies that, assuming consistent turnout and methodology (and no major influx of new supporters offsetting defections), approximately 94% (43.7 / 46.4) of his pre-scandal support level remains intact overall. This equates to a defection rate of about 6% among those who would have supported him before the scandal. The informed ballot suggests potentially lower retention (around 86%), but this may reflect push-poll effects from highlighting the texts.

This overall retention figure is a reasonable proxy for Democratic support trends, as Democrats comprised the bulk of Jones’ base pre-scandal. The small aggregate shift suggests limited defections from his core supporters, likely with most erosion coming from independents or undecideds rather than Democrats. The claim’s 93% figure (implying 93% of Democrats still support him, or do not view the texts as disqualifying) aligns closely with this extrapolated retention rate and is plausible given the modest poll movements. However, as noted previously, the claim stems from an unreleased, partisan Republican poll lacking transparency, so it remains unverified—though not contradicted by available data. ￼ ￼ ￼

In early 2016, I was surprised at the support Trump already had at rallies. I remember not understanding his nomination but it took me only few months to turn around. I was a little jealous of the early supporters because it must mean they had the immediate perception of hope.

As people say, there are the three levels of acceptance: the early adopters, the majority, and the laggards. 

For the early adopters: Why was it easy for you? What ideas appealed to you, even though he was new to politics?

1o5pjac,njblevw,Why we celebrate Columbus Day.,2025-10-13 19:06:00+00:00,14,"As Italians began to settle in major cities across the United States, they often faced religious and ethnic discrimination. This hostility was exemplified by the lynching of 11 innocent Sicilians in New Orleans in 1891, which remains the largest mass lynching in U.S. history. The incident had serious national repercussions; Italy cut off diplomatic relations with the United States, sparking rumors of an impending war. Most anti-Italian sentiment in the U.S. was directed at Southern Italians, particularly Sicilians. In the American South, Southern Italians were often not considered full-fledged members of the ""white race."" The U.S. Bureau of Immigration reinforced this distinction by classifying Northern and Southern Italians as two different races.

Historical accounts substantiate the view of Sicilians as victims of white racism. Many American newspapers of the time were largely sympathetic to the lynchers and anti-Italian in tone. In response to this growing awareness, in 1892, President Benjamin Harrison became the first president to call for a national observance of Columbus Day, in honor of the 400th anniversary of Columbus's arrival in the New World. Harrison's proclamation celebrated both the hard work of the American people and Columbus, stating, ""On this day, let the people, so far as possible, cease from toil and devote themselves to such exercises as may best express honor to the discoverer and their appreciation of the greatest achievements of the four completed centuries of American life."" The proclamation, however, contained no substantial references to Columbus's life, work, or nationality, focusing instead on his journey and the progress America had made since that time."

1o5pjac,njddoaj,Why we celebrate Columbus Day.,2025-10-14 00:56:11+00:00,1,"If the South Americans got good boats and guns first, then Europe would have been conquered in the same fashion. People are people no matter the ethnicity.

Our history is sacred - it makes us who we are. It is okay if bad people do productive things. America is an amazing part of humanity. The great melting pot and fertile ground for modern industrialzation that has lifted the ranks of the poor and especially middle class to a higher standard of living than kings of yester-year.

Let's not shy away from shining a light on the barbaric nature of our past and also instill in ourselves and families values that will lift our society into a more just and productive future.

Also Columbus just got to the islands and South America. Why did we keep calling the natives indians for hundreds of years after we figured out they were not from India pretty early on? How lazy is our cultural vocabulary? Simple misrepresentations are the backbone of institutional deception."

There are small pockets of organized groups who use the label, but there is certainly no grand antifa organization with a centralized cash flow, administration, or network which would be required to justify the administration to mobilize anything to ""combat"" the movement at that level.   
  
It's really silly, and in this case, Jimmy's writers nailed it; a lot of folks in here have bitten hook/line."

Are there that many Israelis in the USA that we care so much for votes? Idts.

But the news outlets who don’t even give a little credit to their president for this huge step is kinda wild. You can bet that if it was Biden that did this. They would be praising their president more than the hostage release situation.
