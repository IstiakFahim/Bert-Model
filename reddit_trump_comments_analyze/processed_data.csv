He is the one they should not have touched and they are trying to spin it for any fence sitters they possibly can because this shines a bright light on them in ways it hasn't been done and stops them from being able to grow there numbers. The fuck nut the did this being left is a huge nail in there coffin possibly the last and they know it.

2025-09-17 05:37:59+00:00,"I think the worst thing about this is, these people literally must not of seen one video of Charlie Kirk. Seeing one video shows he’s a pretty reasonable guy with a good heart. They literally just head “he was a conservative” and assume sexist, homophobe racist. There are plenty of videos out there of Charlie standing up for gay conservatives and not a shred of evidence of racism. It’s cringe how unhinged this all is."
2025-09-17 05:45:21+00:00,I left a review too. They are being absolutely slaughtered by left wing babies that can’t handle a difference of opinion. Literally destroying a business’ reputation based on a respectful gesture to Charlie. The modern world is a disgrace.

I’ve been to many similar shows around the world and SLC is was peak debauchery. I got the impression that the Mormons are very strict and when people rebelled they went hard. I imagine it’s true for any subculture group there.

2025-09-17 12:38:11+00:00,The Left hasn't been challenged on all this nuttinss for 40 years. The culture is changing. The Left has slowly pushed society into tolerating a 300 pound man claiming to be a mom ready to give birth. Since the election the change has been palpable. Folks like Charlie have been a huge part of that culture shift. The Left is lashing out. It doesnt matter though. Charlie won and the cultural shift is in motion.

Too often, people seem more interested in downvoting and self-righteously arguing than actually engaging. Even news subs that should be neutral end up filled with propaganda.

Lucy Connoly was sentenced to 30 months in prison because, still grieving a lost child, she posted something that UK government didn't like. Jimmy Kimmel lost his well paying job and got deplatformed for lying about the murder of a beloved public figure. Tyler Robinson is not a hard right conservative. Fact. Fuck him. He knew what he was do"

2025-09-21 00:02:57+00:00,My wife (lib) sent me the video of Kirk talking about “black processing power” and I admit it threw me a bit even though having watched him for a while I’m 100% sure he’s not a racist. I think he was making the traditional “soft bigotry of low expectations” argument against DEI which is accurate and mainstream conservative but honestly he was pretty ham handed there. I know it’s unfair that the libs are digging through everything Charlie ever said but I’m on the front line guys help me out.

The ""theory"" of gender as a construct was created by a In the early Gay Rights movement, Transsexuals (those who have gender dysphoria) were distinguished between Transvestites (those with a fetish, often sexual, for wearing opposite sex clothing or passing as the opposite sex in public). The Marxists have conflated the two under the same heading ""transgender"". They are not the same thing. A transsexual may be a man who may have reassignment surgery and wish to marry a man. "

2025-09-29 11:49:21+00:00,he should but he won’t. politics is so much ego. keep in mind a mamdani win probably makes sliwa more visible later so his brand becomes more valuable. if he cares about NYC he’ll withdraw however.

Not only will they leave, it will attract only those who want to take advantage of it. So when those Corps leave cuz of the tax hike…it will only leave them to pay for it. Let them deal with it on their own. The people need to understand what the Dems will do…let them feel it. Be thankful it’s not National."

2025-09-30 22:57:49+00:00,TrumpRX.com is also becoming a thing. I didn't hear it was exclusive to medicaid.

And these nitwits call me a nazi for being a zionist conservative jew. And they ban me for being a zionist. And they call me the nazi. They need to take a good hard look in the mirror. Also what does nazi stand for hm? SOCIALIST PARTY.
2025-10-01 01:09:52+00:00,"Resorting to calling you a Nazi, expected. That type of language motivates liberals to hurt or kill conservatives.

Instead, it was just a personal-ban-cuz-momma-said-pancakes-are-ready type ban with no thought put into it other than a personal one. I have several bans just because I’ve commented here. Now it’s a game on how "

One of the founders even says that Wikipedia is super left political leaning. I sure hope that Wikipedia financially dies soon.

2025-10-06 18:35:20+00:00,"The left hasn’t won an election in over a decade, but the depth of their lies and corruption did allow for a stolen election in 2020. Fortunately, Americans have seen the depth of their blatant corruption and hypocrisy, and now there will be a voter ID requirement in every state, county, and city. Trump’s presidential win in 2024 would have been even greater if it weren’t for the corruption of No Voter ID liberal state remnants."

The first is that while the right couldn't stand either one of them, they didn't live rent free in our heads for 12 years. So we didn't make EVERYTHING about them. The second thing is the transparency of Trump's presidency. We didn't hear shit from Biden for 4 years and Obama did everything in secret.

2025-10-08 12:51:59+00:00,Welcome smiling_face_with_open_hands to the club. I would love to see what the mods look like in person and put their lives under a microscope to see just how awful and miserable they are.
2025-10-08 13:00:10+00:00,I think you all need to post about this at 10 more times per day because the 30 posts a day you’re already making just aren’t getting the point across
2025-10-08 13:02:37+00:00,Superbowl tickets are very expensive. Does anyone think poor migrant farm workers got tickets?

Also, the blanket pardoning of all J6 political prisoners was a genuinely beautiful thing. It's horrifying to think many people were locked up for years on end for the crime of walking on property that we, as ordinary American tax payers, ostensibly own!"

2025-10-08 13:27:51+00:00,"You get banned from the sub for disagreeing with the fuckin idiot mods and the leftards posting heinous shit there. Reddit needs to clean up its mods team. Root out all the fucktards directing discussion towards ' wah Trump, wah Palestine'."

2025-10-08 13:56:59+00:00,"I was banned from the Nashville sub in 2020 for complaining about my bosses bar that he owns getting partly destroyed by liberals and BLM rioters. I had been on there for a few years with absolutely no issues. Until this day, they will not let me back in lol. It's just turned into a liberal wasteland."
2025-10-08 14:05:07+00:00,Winning!
2025-10-08 14:12:47+00:00,Because misery loves company. It's come down to tribalism. Liberals don't get the love & attention they need so they need to be part of a tribe for validation.

Immigration? i was beginning to feel like my housekeeping lady was a rapist, murderer and drug dealer..i mean i was basically bankrolling her criminal empire. I can’t wait till he deploys the NG to Portland, those people in costumes are frightening me."
2025-10-08 15:12:55+00:00,Because the man owns everything. The left controls media and unless it's part of it's message you'll be censored. The left imitates dictatorship way more than the right
2025-10-08 15:25:38+00:00,Everything
2025-10-08 15:28:41+00:00,"I have to give the moderators of r/Trump credit, a week ago I was suddenly banned for no reason. Respectfully, I inquired as to “why?” I was banned, by simply clicking the accompanying chat request link. Less than an hour later my permission’s were restored, with a response telling me I’d been caught in a ban wave. My guess is a “ban wave” is the result of a liberal(s) who lost an argument with a conservative."
2025-10-08 15:42:26+00:00,Trump did his duty to save America. It's funny and concerning seeing leftists think that Trump will somehow be a king. Next president needs to be harder on Europe. Trump is too soft.
2025-10-08 15:44:00+00:00,"Just got banned from the xmen sub just because i commented here, reddit is wastebasket"
2025-10-08 15:44:04+00:00,I’ve been banned on that sub for years now. They only post anti Trump shit anyways so it’s not like I’m missing out on much

2025-10-08 17:05:23+00:00,"Headline: ""Man arrested at outside Mass marking start of Supreme Court term had 200 explosive devices: Police"" Pretty crazy, he had homemade explosives and was planning a domestic terrorists attack. Luckily cops caught him."

But you bet your ass once the left starts doing some shit they want to do, what do we call them? Little Stalins? Maoists? They probably wouldn't understand the reference, being the simpletons they are. Maybe, DIM-JONG-UNs?"

2025-10-08 17:54:42+00:00,Reddit is a hard left platform. Unfortunately that's a typical outcome. Next is auto banning on a variety of subs for even posting here.

2025-10-08 18:29:22+00:00,"Mainly because they cannot accept reality. Most of the young people on Reddit grew up without accountability. Kids who played sports ""won"" participation trophies to spare their poor little feelings. Most want YOU to always be wrong. It's their way or the highway. They want everything handed to them on a silver platter without having to actually work for it. They simply live in a social media algorithmic driven world."
2025-10-08 18:35:53+00:00,Do any of these students receive federal aid? Are they taking up a seat that would otherwise be filled by a citizen?
2025-10-08 18:49:56+00:00,"They dont ""get"" a number so much as commit identity theft and fraud. The IRS absolutely knows and can easily tell what numbers are in use by citizens and what are being used by illegals who committed identity theft. And dont think the social security tax the illegal pays will help you. That is funnelled into the general fund, which is why many politicians never cared. THERE ARE AT LEAST 50 MILLION ILLEGALS IN THE USA RIGHT NOW"
2025-10-08 18:51:58+00:00,Good one. Immediately downvoted then changed to an upvote after watching the video
2025-10-08 19:00:40+00:00,"Half of Reddit are liberal soy boys living in their parents homes and have little to no life experience, much less an educated thought based on facts. 45% are bots up voting misinformation to keep the 50% brainwashed and believing they are on the ""right"" side of history. The other 5% are normal people, republican and democrat who can participate in civil conversation and a differing of opinions. Give or take a few percentage points in any of these categories. Ultimately, don't fret over anything you see or "
2025-10-08 19:13:06+00:00,"We can't do anything to make somebody get off their lazy ass and work. We can't do anything to get people to save money and cook food instead of ""financing door dash orders"" (Yes, there is an app for that now) We have the freedom to succeed and we also have the freedom to be lazy sacks of shit and play video games all day. People don't even want to diet and lose weight. It's entirely possible. Look at the intermittent fasting subreddit. thousands of people who made a decision to better their life and health"

2025-10-08 19:30:33+00:00,"I am unhappy with both parties right now. If you voted for the trump administration I advise looking into how it has ACTUALLY delivered on the things ya'll thought were important. If you really think that 1.5 T healthcare funds are going to fraudsters then you are gravely misinformed. Do some research on what your party has done for you instead of listening to mainstream media (Fox, CNN, etc.) talking heads who want to manipulate you."
2025-10-08 19:37:52+00:00,The delusion she has of being America’s future president? That’s laughable out loud. zany_face
2025-10-08 19:38:17+00:00,"The first 5 books of the bible say that death is the penalty for taking a life. That's God's opinion. Children are innocent, once you are age 13 you are accountable for your actions/sin. God is pro-birth and God is pro-death penalty. Doesn't matter if you like it, your opinion is not higher than Gods. So this pope is clearly a low-tier biblical scholar and his opinion doesn't represent God's opinion."

2025-10-08 20:11:43+00:00,"That reads like satire. ""Reddit is America's last hope, the rest of the world is an echo chamber of differing and dissenting views."" is the tipoff."
2025-10-08 20:21:11+00:00,It's concerning that so many leftists are in such a state of mental degradation that they honestly believe this.

2025-10-08 20:44:40+00:00,"It reads like a fucking satirical post, but you just know that they're 100% serious about it and that's just a travesty in itself. I think it's highly likely a lot of the looney Lefty shooters were indoctrinated on reddit or discord."

2025-10-08 20:58:55+00:00,So they just want every subreddit to have hate posts against MAGA and Trump even if the subs have nothing to do with politics? ONLY 9 or 10 posts? And calling the rest of the world an echo chamber while living in the biggest echo chamber of all (reddit)? Talk about the pot calling the kettle black....

2025-10-08 21:36:23+00:00,These people don’t know their history and have no clue what Hitler was really about . They don’t know what they are saying by calling people Nazis and such . They should read some literature about Third Reich . Maybe just maybe they will understand what they are comparing people to . That should be considered hate speech in my book . That in itself is racism.

2025-10-10 19:31:23+00:00,Trump said that the prize doesn’t matter. The only thing that matters is if the American people know what he’s doing.

Giving an award like that to someone whose greatest achievement was killing a shitload of people from the air immediately invali"

2025-10-10 20:21:29+00:00,And they hide the fact that they want to know who we vote for so they can know who to attack and who to prevent from voting. A antifascist fighting fascism with more fascism < their logic.

This is why cost of living is high, which means paying Americans a livable wage is hard which leads to off shoring. Republicans especially in Texas are doing a better job of it. But everything boils down to housing."

I was a little jealous of the early supporters because it must mean they had the immediate perception of hope. As people say, there are the three levels of acceptan"
